Venture funding for Singapore start-ups weakens in 2022,"SINGAPORE - The amount of venture capital funding raised by Singapore-headquartered tech companies dipped last year, as investors turned cautious amid an uncertain macroeconomic climate.
Annual deal volume in 2022 dropped 11 per cent year on year to 651, while total deal value dipped 3 per cent to US$11 billion (S$14.8 billion), a report from Enterprise Singapore and DealStreetAsia showed. The study primarily tracked equity fundraising – debt funding, bridge loans, initial coin offerings and grants were excluded.
Deal value was propped up by a further injection of US$1.63 billion by Alibaba Group into its subsidiary Lazada Group.
The number of equity deals involving Singapore start-ups has been on a downward trend beginning from the fourth quarter of 2021. Deal volume dropped from 244 during the quarter to 133 in Q4 2022.
The quarterly data raises concerns over the potential for a further slowdown in venture funding this year, the report noted.
Still, a number of start-ups managed to raise blockbuster funding rounds that helped Singapore maintain the lion’s share of equity fundraising in South-east Asia. The Reupublic took home 63.8 per cent of deal value last year, followed by Indonesia at 21.9 per cent.
Top deals included fintech Coda Payments’ raise of US$690 million from GIC, Insight Partners and others, as well as data-centre operator Princeton Digital’s raise of US$500 million in a round led by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala.
Early-stage deals remained robust, with the median value of seed rounds rising 82.4 per cent to US$2.7 million, and that of Series A rounds rising 60 per cent to US$10 million.
Overall, investments up to the Series B stage recorded a 12.3 per cent increase, despite an 8.2 per cent fall in volume.
The impact of the investor pullback was more visible among mature companies, as new private valuations began to mimic the public-market decline.
The median value of Series C rounds dropped 14.3 per cent to US$45 million, while that of Series D rounds plunged 66.1 per cent to US$50 million.
“Many crossover funds, which were active in late-stage investments, took a step back after their publicly-listed portfolios took a beating in the stock market rout,” the authors of the report said.
In deep tech – a key growth area for Singapore – deal value fell 24 per cent from a historic high to US$1.95 billion. Deal volume decreased from 198 to 127.
The report, however, noted a healthy pipeline of new ventures for the ecosystem. Singapore’s deep-tech startups closed 116 early-stage deals in 2022, with 41 comprising seed-stage deals.
Meanwhile, companies continued to mature, with at least 21 seed-stage start-ups graduating to the Series A stage, and another seven companies raising Series B funding.
Companies such as Biofourmis and Mirxes, which focus on advanced biomedical technology, secured late-stage funding of US$320 million and US$87 million, respectively.
The Singapore government has continued to spur start-up investments through co-funding initiatives. Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, committed more than $40 million and catalysed $132 million of private funding into 36 early-stage startups in 2022. This is almost double the amount from five years ago, said Enterprise Singapore.

10-month-old Australian baby forced to vape as mother watches on,"NEW SOUTH WALES - A 10-month-old baby was seen inhaling smoke from an electronic vaporiser in a video posted online as his mother watched on.
The Facebook clip showed the baby being forced, allegedly by his aunt, to inhale the smoke, as his mother watched on in amusement. He was seen coughing and sputtering out the smoke afterwards.
Laughter could be heard in the background.
“Want to try?” a woman said, before she placed the e-vaporiser in his mouth again.
The incident is believed to have happened in Kempsey, a town in Australia.
The video sparked anger among netizens and called for the baby to be taken away from his mother.
One social media user called the act “sickening”.
Another said: “How can you put the vape up to your own son’s mouth and watch him suck on it and laugh while he’s choking and coughing?”
New South Wales police conducted an investigation after receiving complaints.
Following advice by medical professionals and government agencies, no arrests were made and the police said no further action will be taken.
Relatives told Australia site 7News they believed the baby was doing “okay”.
In response to the outrage on social media sites, the baby’s mother, whose identity has not been released, asked netizens to stop making comments about the incident.

No tongue? Chinese ‘kissing’ contraption is both bizarre and lip-smackingly enticing,"This takes “blowing a kiss” to a whole new – some say romantic, others, downright creepy – level.
An inventor at a university in China has patented a contraption that mimics the sensation, and even the sound, of kissing.
It uses silicon “lips” that move with actuators and pressure sensors, and speakers that emit the muah, smacky, slurpy sounds that accompany kisses: be it a little peck or two mouths locked in a long, drawn-out smooch.
To send this virtual kiss, users will have to download an app and attach the kissing device into their mobile phone’s charging port, and then pair their app with their partners’.
They can then start a video call and sink their lips into a soft silicon replica of lips protruding like a bird’s beak from beneath the device.
Of course, the sight of it, and people actually using it, have stirred a range of emotions, mostly in the spectrum of amused and creeped out.
“I don’t understand (the device), but I’m utterly shocked,” said one top comment on the Twitter-like Chinese platform Weibo.
Other responses were more, well, tongue in cheek.
“No tongue? I’ll wait for version 2.0,” says user BuffaloBear on the Gizmodo website.
Another user on the site, Brian_KA, said: “They should just call this thing ‘The Canadian Girlfriend.’”
There were those who were more forgiving.

Brentford's Toney seeks FA leak inquiry over ban reports,"FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - West Ham United v Brentford - London Stadium, London, Britain - December 30, 2022 Brentford's Ivan Toney celebrates scoring their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers
Brentford striker Ivan Toney has requested England's Football Association (FA) conduct a leak inquiry following British media reports about a confidential hearing into his alleged breaches of betting rules and the possible ban he faces.
The Daily Mail reported on Tuesday Toney could face a lengthy ban after he pleaded guilty to many of the 262 charges issued by the FA in December but denied others.
""I was shocked and disappointed to see press speculation yesterday and today about the FA investigation process concerning me after I have been told by the FA that it is a confidential process until any decision has been made,"" Toney said on Instagram on Wednesday.
""It is especially disturbing for me to read that the FA is saying I shall be banned from football for 6 months before there has even been a hearing, and it does make me worried about the process.
""My lawyers will be writing to the FA to request that they conduct a leak inquiry, as this is the second time stories have appeared in the newspapers - the last time was just before the selection of the England World Cup squad.""
The FA said in November it was alleged Toney breached the betting rules 232 times between 2017 and 2021. The following month he was charged with a further 30 alleged breaches of the betting rules.
The FA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

KUALA LUMPUR: More than 27,000 people have been evacuated in the Malaysian states of Johor, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan and Melaka when their homes were hit by floods due to heavy rain brought by the northeast monsoon.
According to the national news agency Bernama, Johor is the worst hit state with more than 25,000 people in relief centres on Thursday morning (Mar 2), compared to 9,162 on Wednesday night.
“Segamat is the worst affected district with 2,050 families evacuated to 55 relief centres, followed by Kluang with 1,559 families at 39 centres; Kota Tinggi with 769 families at 18 centres; Johor Bahru with 607 at 12 centres and Pontian involving 58 families at five centres,” Bernama quoted a statement from the Johor State Disaster Management Committee.
The Star reported that all 10 districts in Johor have been hit by floods with more than 25,000 people having to be evacuated, a four-fold increase from the 5,679 flood victims recorded just 20 hours before.
Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi said an emergency meeting with all agencies was on Wednesday night following the “critical flood situation” in the state.
He said that the meeting was briefed about the situation in Segamat, particularly in Chaah, Pemanis, Tenang and Labis.
“I have asked the agencies involved to manage the logistics for the delivery of tents and retort (ready to eat) food to the affected area,” he said in a Facebook post following the meeting.
In Pahang, the number of evacuees in five districts rose to 1,375 people from 374 families on Thursday, up from 293 people on Wednesday night and all of them were housed at 26 relief centres, according to Bernama.
More than 700 people had to be evacuated in Negeri Sembilan, while the number of evacuees in Melaka rose to 67 people.
The Malaysian Meteorological Department forecasted on Thursday that rain will hit several parts of Johor from Thursday afternoon to Friday night.
According to the Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID), the water levels of 16 rivers in Johor have exceeded danger levels, as of 11am on Thursday.
Two rivers which have exceeded danger levels the most, namely Sungai Lenik and Sungai Gemas, are located in Segamat and have breached the danger level by 2.5m and 1.96m respectively.

JAKARTA : Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil exporter, plans to require palm oil exports to go through a futures exchange in order to create the country's own benchmark price, the head of its commodity futures regulator said on Thursday.
Authorities are developing a trading scheme for crude palm oil which aims to launch in June, said Didid Noordiatmoko, head of the regulator, BAPPEBTI.

Novel electrocatalysts for hydrogen production offer hope for solving the energy crisis,"[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]
Two efficient and inexpensive novel electrocatalysts for hydrogen production offering sustainable green solutions for the energy crisis have been developed by City University of Hong Kong (CityU).
Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels while the production of low- cost, high-performance hydrogen evolution catalysts is a core problem in the energy field.
A research team co-led by CityU materials scientists has recently developed an innovative, ultra-stable and highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst.
Electrochemical HER is a widely used hydrogen-generation method. Commercial HER electrocatalysts are made from expensive precious metals. A promising type of HER electrocatalyst intensively studied by scientists is single-atom catalysts for their potential in catalytic HER applications because of their high activity, maximised atomic efficiency, and minimised catalyst usage. However, the fabrication of single-atom catalysts is generally complicated, and requires a lot of energy and time.
The new electrocatalyst is based on two-dimensional mineral gel nanosheets and does not contain any precious metals. It can be produced on a large scale and help achieve a lower hydrogen price in the future.
“Compared with other common single-atom substrate precursors, such as porous frameworks and carbon, we found that mineral hydrogels have great advantages for the mass production of electrocatalysts owing to the easy availability of the raw materials, a simple, environmentally friendly synthetic procedure, and mild reaction conditions,” said Professor Lu Jian, Chair Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MNE) and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at CityU, who led the research.
The experiments found that the new catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, long- term durability and ultra-stability.
The findings were published in Nature Communications under the title “Two-dimensional mineral hydrogel-derived single atoms-anchored heterostructures for ultrastable hydrogen evolution”.
Another breakthrough by Professor Lu’s team is a new type of hydrogen evolution catalyst.
“Using a simple method called magnetron co-sputtering, my research team has successfully produced a high-performance, low-cost substitute for platinum-based electrocatalysts, providing an effective solution to this problem,” said Professor Lu.
The new electrocatalyst, based on AlMnRu (aluminium, manganese and ruthenium) films, has a crystalline-amorphous (non-crystalline) dual-phase nanostructure. Dual-phase materials are needed because each phase has separate benefits: the local chemical inhomogeneity, short-range order and severe lattice distortion in the nanocrystalline phase are desirable, while the amorphous phase offers abundant active sites with a lower energy barrier for hydrogen evolution reaction.

Two efficient and inexpensive novel electrocatalysts for hydrogen production offering sustainable green solutions for the energy crisis have been developed by City University of Hong Kong (CityU).
Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels while the production of low- cost, high-performance hydrogen evolution catalysts is a core problem in the energy field.
A research team co-led by CityU materials scientists has recently developed an innovative, ultra-stable and highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst.
Electrochemical HER is a widely used hydrogen-generation method. Commercial HER electrocatalysts are made from expensive precious metals. A promising type of HER electrocatalyst intensively studied by scientists is single-atom catalysts for their potential in catalytic HER applications because of their high activity, maximised atomic efficiency, and minimised catalyst usage. However, the fabrication of single-atom catalysts is generally complicated, and requires a lot of energy and time.
The new electrocatalyst is based on two-dimensional mineral gel nanosheets and does not contain any precious metals. It can be produced on a large scale and help achieve a lower hydrogen price in the future.
“Compared with other common single-atom substrate precursors, such as porous frameworks and carbon, we found that mineral hydrogels have great advantages for the mass production of electrocatalysts owing to the easy availability of the raw materials, a simple, environmentally friendly synthetic procedure, and mild reaction conditions,” said Professor Lu Jian, Chair Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MNE) and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at CityU, who led the research.
The experiments found that the new catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, long- term durability and ultra-stability.
The findings were published in Nature Communications under the title “Two-dimensional mineral hydrogel-derived single atoms-anchored heterostructures for ultrastable hydrogen evolution”.
Another breakthrough by Professor Lu’s team is a new type of hydrogen evolution catalyst.
“Using a simple method called magnetron co-sputtering, my research team has successfully produced a high-performance, low-cost substitute for platinum-based electrocatalysts, providing an effective solution to this problem,” said Professor Lu.
The new electrocatalyst, based on AlMnRu (aluminium, manganese and ruthenium) films, has a crystalline-amorphous (non-crystalline) dual-phase nanostructure. Dual-phase materials are needed because each phase has separate benefits: the local chemical inhomogeneity, short-range order and severe lattice distortion in the nanocrystalline phase are desirable, while the amorphous phase offers abundant active sites with a lower energy barrier for hydrogen evolution reaction.
“This aluminium-based alloy electrocatalyst has unique bonding states, a small lattice size, and crystalline/amorphous coexistence, providing a structural basis for achieving high catalytic efficiency,” Prof Lu explained. “We use aluminium rather than a noble metal as the principal element of the catalyst, and ruthenium, which is cheaper than platinum, as the noble metal component.”

Djokovic targets elusive gold medal at Paris Olympics,"March 2 (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic said he is already looking forward to next year's Olympic Games in Paris, as he seeks to win a gold medal that has so far eluded him in an otherwise glittering career.
World number one Djokovic won a bronze medal in Beijing 2008 but has been unable to build on that in 2012, 2016 and 2021. The Serbian said he hopes to be fit and healthy for next year's showpiece, by which time he will be 37.
The tennis competition at Paris 2024 will be held on the claycourts of Roland Garros where Djokovic has won two of his 22 Grand Slam titles -- in 2016 and 2021.
""I look forward to the Olympics,"" Djokovic told reporters after beating Tallon Griekspoor in Dubai on Wednesday. ""I hope I'll be able to play healthy for next year in Paris.
""It's going to be played on clay at Roland Garros, so I'm familiar with those grounds. I hope the best Olympic result for me will come there.""
Australian Open champion Djokovic is into a record-breaking 378th week at number one after surpassing Steffi Graf and said he was hungry for more records and success.
""I always try to be very clear with myself what the goals are, what I want from competitive tennis,"" Djokovic said.
""This is the way I've been brought up and taught by some of the key people in my life, including my parents, and some of the coaches I had early on.

Analysis | India cheers the return of 'King Coal' as industry sees buoyant future,"The coal industry’s confidence in a prosperous future for itself stands in contrast to India’s commitment to “phase down” coal-fired power generation and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070
At the Coaltrans India conference, there was consensus that coal production in India will jump to around 1.4 billion tonnes per annum by 2030 from around 1 billion tonnes currently. Image for representation | Photo Credit: Reuters
India's coal industry celebrated the return of its major conference after a three-year pandemic hiatus by presenting a bullish view of demand, rising supply from new mines and strong demand for imports.
""King coal is coming back and coming with a big bang,"" Anil Kumar Jha, the chairman of Jindal Power Ltd., told the Coaltrans India conference, held this week for the first time since February 2020.
The sentiment was echoed by virtually every speaker at the event, although there was a wide variety of views as to how successful India will be at ramping up coal domestic coal output, and how quickly this can replace imports.
The industry's confidence in a long and prosperous future for itself stands in contrast to India's commitment to ""phase down"" coal-fired power generation and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070.
There was no talk at all of phasing down coal at the event, rather the debate centred on just how high India's coal demand will rise, with the consensus being it will jump to around 1.4 billion tonnes per annum by 2030 from around 1 billion tonnes currently.
As is always the case, the trick is separating the hype from the reality, and also distinguishing between short-term market dynamics and long-term trends.
Increased output
The reality is that India has successfully increased domestic coal output, with official government figures released last week showing production in the first 10 months of the fiscal year that started in April 2022 reached 698.25 million tonnes, up 16% over the same period a year earlier.
It's likely that India's full-year output in the 2022-23 fiscal year will reach a record high, although still fall short of a target for just over 900 million tonnes.
The question is whether Coal India, the state-controlled miner that accounts for about 80% of the country's total output, can continue to ramp up production at double-digit annual growth rates.
And even if Coal India can achieve what it has never been able to do in the past, can the railway and ports systems keep up with the increased output?
India is also betting that private mining companies will start to make a bigger contribution to domestic output as they start bringing mines to production.
Overall, the trend does appear to be for rising domestic output, but if history is any guide, it's also likely that India will fall short of its longer-term targets.
The question is by how much, and whether the country will be able to source sufficient imports at a price that its utilities can afford.
Imports gaining
In the short term, India's imports of seaborne thermal coal are likely to accelerate, especially since the government invoked emergency measures last week requiring power plants that use imported fuel to operate at full capacity in order to avert potential electricity shortfalls as the summer demand peak approaches.
India's coal arrivals are already heading higher, with data from commodity analysts Kpler pointing to a rise in thermal coal imports to 10.19 million tonnes in February, up from 9.71 million tonnes in January and the most since November.
Over the longer term, the trajectory for imports will depend on how successful India is at boosting domestic coal production, and shifting volumes around the country.
It's likely that thermal coal imports may decline over the coming years, but predictions that this trade will end by 2030 are ambitious.
Where India will see increasing coal imports is in higher-grade metallurgical coal, used primarily to make steel.
India produces only small amounts of this grade of coal, also known as coking coal, and given the expected increase in steel production, it's expected that coking coal imports will rise from around 63 million tonnes a year currently to around 100 million by 2030.
Excess coal required?
There was one question that participants at the Coaltrans India event were likely to skip around, and that was whether this additional coal the industry expects to produce will actually be needed.
India is rapidly rolling out renewable energies such as solar and wind, as well as boosting hydro generation.
In the 2021-22 fiscal year some 15.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity was installed, but only 1.4 GW of new coal-fired generation.
While thermal generation still accounts for 59% of India's total capacity, the share of renewables is rising and was at 27% in March 2022, according to data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
The share of renewables is expected to rise to at least 40% by 2030, and may even climb to half of India's generation capacity.
India is building new coal-fired power plants, with data from the Global Energy Monitor showing 32 GW currently being built.
Given that each GW of generation requires around 3 million tonnes of coal annually, this implies the coming capacity additions will only need another 100 million tonnes, well below the 500 million tonnes extra the industry believes it will deliver by 2030.
There are other coal users, such as cement producers, but it's unlikely they will need massive new volumes.
Overall, it appears the positive mood of India's coal sector is justified, especially in the short term. But their vision of massive increases in output and demand for decades to come may yet prove overly optimistic.

And the next site-specific study for coastal protection, covering Sungei Kadut and Lim Chu Kang, will start later this year."
"Committee of Supply 2023 debate, Day 5: Grace Fu on stewarding a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore","Singapore must press ahead with its inter-generational effort to steward a green, liveable and climate-resilient home for its people and future generations, said Sustainability and the Environment Minister Grace Fu. Speaking in Parliament on Thursday (Mar 2), she outlined ways in which the Government is leading, enabling and facilitating Singapore’s transition to a climate-friendly nation. For a start, the public sector will lead the way in Singapore’s decarbonisation journey and pave the way for green efforts to take root. Under the GreenGov.SG initiative, the public sector has committed to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of the national target. Agencies are pushing ahead with decarbonising their systems and processes. From this financial year (FY), the Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report, showing its efforts, progress and plans. It will start with reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as electricity and water consumption, with reference to international standards and frameworks. From FY2024, all statutory boards will make their annual environmental sustainability disclosures. Several statutory boards have started making sustainability disclosures and are incorporating sustainability in their decision-making and risk management frameworks to achieve concrete outcomes. Ms Fu said the public sector will raise the bar by leveraging its procurement budget. From 2024, besides prequalifying the products on environmental standards, it will also consider the sustainability practices of the company it buys from, starting with large construction and ICT tenders. These make up more than 60 per cent of the value of Government procurement contracts. Such projects include public infrastructure, industrial buildings and office ICT equipment contracts. As this is a new concept, it will start with setting aside up to five per cent of the evaluation points for environmental sustainability. Ms Fu said the Government will review the amount and engage industry closely as it expands the sustainability criteria to more procurement sectors. She pointed out that environmental sustainability is not costless, and consumers will have to pay ""a bit more"" for greener goods and services. She stressed that green procurement in the public sector will encourage suppliers to adopt sustainability practices and develop greener products and services. She hopes the private sector will follow suit to publish sustainability reports and incorporate sustainability considerations in procurement policies. Turning to businesses and the community, Ms Fu outlined ways to get them to “do more with less”. The Government is allowing companies to use high-quality international carbon credits (ICCs) to offset up to five per cent of their taxable emissions. A whitelist of acceptable ICCs will be published later this year. To support an inclusive transition, the Government will help small- and medium-sized enterprises make the switch. The Energy Efficiency Fund will be enhanced to provide manufacturing companies with certainty of the grant amount upfront when they invest in energy-efficient equipment. The grant application process will be simplified and streamlined. Turning to households, the Government will add energy labels to portable air-conditioners and more types of lamps next year. “The Government will lay the foundations for a green Singapore that is climate-friendly and climate-ready. But we will only make headway if this is a shared vision and if we all take collective steps along this journey,” said Ms Fu.

Students to enter secondary school via posting groups mapped from current streams; form classes will be mixed,"A common Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate exam will replace the O-Levels and N-Levels from 2027.
SINGAPORE: Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 batch, all students will be posted into secondary schools in three groups, mapped from the existing score ranges for the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams.
The three posting groups will be used to facilitate school admission and guide the subject levels students offer at the start of the year, said the Ministry of Education (MOE).
“Beyond that, posting groups will not shape the secondary school experience,” said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in his speech during the Committee of Supply debates on Wednesday (Mar 1).
This ensures that schools continue to admit students with diverse strengths, and students continue to have access to a wide range of schools, he added.
“By admitting students from different posting groups, schools can also enable diversity at the class level, with mixed form classes that comprise students offering subjects at different subject levels,” said Mr Chan.
In schools that take in students from multiple posting groups, mixed form classes mean each class will be made up of students from different posting groups, taking subjects at different levels.
With full subject-based banding implemented across 120 schools from next year, students will sit for a common Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exam from 2027, regardless of their initial posting group.
The SEC will replace the current O-Level and N-Level certificates, which current students sit for at the end of four or five years in secondary school.
The option of spending a fifth year in secondary school will remain available to students who want to take subjects at a more demanding level, said Mr Chan.
About 80 per cent of secondary schools will implement full subject-based banding, said MOE.
The remaining schools include integrated programme schools such as Raffles Institution, which only accept students from posting group 3 – currently the Express stream. Crest Secondary School will also remain a specialised school that offers a customised curriculum for students in posting group 1 – currently the Normal (Technical) stream.
However, these schools can still allow students to take subjects at a more demanding or less demanding level, said MOE.
Currently, students can already take English, mathematics, science and mother tongue at a higher level in Secondary 1 if they did well in the subjects at the PSLE. This option will be expanded to humanities subjects at Secondary 2 from 2024.
Previously, without mixed form classes and full subject-based banding, a school that accepted students from all three streams would typically see classes made up of only Express students, N(A) students or N(T) students. These students would also only take subjects at the level of their stream and then take the corresponding O-Level or N-Level examinations.

Netflix brings Stranger Things to the stage in London’s West End,"LONDON – Netflix’s smash-hit streaming series Stranger Things (2016 to present) is about to get its theatre debut.
The prequel, Stranger Things: The First Shadow, will be set in Hawkins in 1959 and follows some familiar characters, including a young Jim Hopper. This will be the streaming giant’s first live stage production.
The show will run at London’s Phoenix Theatre in late 2023. It will be written by Kate Trefry, who also worked on the television series.
The story is by Trefry, Stranger Things creators the Duffer brothers, and Jack Thorne, who penned the stageplay for Harry Potter And The Cursed Child.
The show is being produced by theatre powerhouse Sonia Friedman Productions, with production company 21 Laps as associate producers.
It will be directed by Stephen Daldry, who has won three Tony Awards for his work on Broadway and an Olivier Award for his work in the West End.
Here is what has been released about the plot of the show so far:
Hawkins, 1959: A regular town with regular worries. Young Jim Hopper’s car will not start, Bob Newby’s sister will not take his radio show seriously and Joyce Maldonado just wants to graduate and get the hell out of town. When new student Henry Creel arrives, his family finds that a fresh start is not so easy… and the shadows of the past have a very long reach.
“The world and mythology of Stranger Things has enabled a rich and fertile ground for creating an incredible story for the stage,” producer Sonia Friedman said in a statement.
“Set within the canon of Stranger Things, this new play opens in London, with the West End hosting the only place in the world to experience this new story – for now.”

Singapore launches $125 million coastal research programme,"SINGAPORE - A $125 million research programme dedicated to strengthening Singapore’s coastal protection and flood management capabilities will be launched, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon on Thursday.
National water agency PUB said that the programme can help to support its nationwide site-specific coastal protection studies, and its coastal and inland flood model, which have been launched to better determine the impact of climate change on Singapore’s coastal areas.
The new programme will consist of four research areas that collectively aim to develop innovative, sustainable and smart solutions for Singapore’s urban and land-squeezed environment – a challenge which many other coastal cities also face, said PUB.
This includes developing sustainable coastal protection solutions, integrating the use of nature-based solutions such as mangroves, and smart management solutions, such as through the use of artificial intelligence.
The programme will be hosted at a new multi-institutional Centre of Excellence (CoE) at the National University of Singapore, with Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) as partner institutes .
Ms Hazel Khoo, Director of PUB’s Coastal Protection Department, said: “Through the CoE, we are looking at creating around 40 to 50 new research jobs, as well as training around 20 to 30 PhD students.
“At the same time, there are synergies for institutions partnering the CoE to develop undergraduate specialisation in coastal engineering and post-graduate programmes in climate adaptation and flood management, so that we can build a sustained pipeline of local professionals for coastal research and the industry.”
With climate change, sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by 2100.
More extreme storms with higher rainfall intensities could become more frequent, resulting in increased flood risks.
As such, it is critical for Singapore to enhance its overall coastal and flood resilience, said PUB.
Ms Khoo said that the programme aims to build knowledge in the modelling of coastal processes, joint occurrences of extreme sea levels, waves and storms, as well as how they will be affected by sea level rise and climate change.
This would be crucial in determining the effects of sea level rise and climate change on coastal processes and inland flooding, providing key inputs to guide the development of optimal solutions, she added.
Dr Koh said: “The (programme’s) applied research and living lab components will support the test-bedding of inter-disciplinary urban flood solutions and equip our industries with the capability to develop and eventually export the next generation of coastal and flood protection solutions.”",2023-03-02 04:42:28.816000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/yaohui-pixgeneric-8287_2.jpg?VersionId=_sFvu4Ycu_VJ8yOrrohcMpCPv__yN3tA,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/singapore-launches-125-million-coastal-research-programme,"Singapore launches $125 million coastal research programmeSINGAPORE - A $125 million research programme dedicated to strengthening Singapore’s coastal protection and flood management capabilities will be launched, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon on Thursday.

Defence contractors target Australia as it gears up to counter China,"· Advanced drones, long-range missiles on display at air show
· To make buys once strategic review made public next month
· Eyeing local production of key items
AVALON, Australia, March 2 (Reuters) - As close U.S. ally Australia gears up to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, global defence contractors this week showed off advanced drones, long-range missiles and military communications satellites at its biggest air show.
The firms are pushing for billions of dollars' worth of purchases expected after Australia's long-awaited defence strategic review (DSR) is made public next month, setting out the force structure and equipment required over the next decade.
Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said securing long-range strike weapons in three to five years should be the priority given China's growing threat to Taiwan and the high likelihood of Australia joining the U.S. in a fight.
""When the DSR comes out there will be diplomatic language that doesn't necessarily squarely target China by name, but I think everyone gets the reality this has been driven by China, its rapid growth and its military capabilities,"" he said on the sidelines of the Australian International Airshow near Melbourne.
Like other countries, Australia is also focusing increasingly on securing more local production and supply stocks after observing the depletions caused by the war in Ukraine.
The government's aim is to ""speed up the acquisition cycle"" and move as quickly as possible once the review is public, Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy told reporters on Wednesday. The federal budget is due in May and the defence allocation is expected to grow.
At the air show, some defence contractors privately expressed frustration that the tightly held review ordered last August, three months after a new centre-left government took office, had slowed down procurement and delivery times.
Major decisions in the balance from the review include whether to order another squadron of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jets, up to four more Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drones and a major military satellite contract being pursued by five groups, including Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N).
""Everyone is reading the tea leaves, but we know a lot of capability will be coming out of that DSR,"" said Stephen Forshaw, Airbus's chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.
Australia ranked 12th globally in military spending in 2021 at $31.8 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It is a major buyer of U.S. equipment in particular, having operated alongside the U.S. in conflicts around the world. In 2021, it formed an alliance with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered submarines.
The air show also highlighted how Australia's smaller force is influencing U.S. purchases. Australia has operated Boeing E-7A airborne early warning and control planes since 2009, as the first customer for the type. The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it planned to buy 26 of them to replace its ageing E-3s.
Boeing is also looking to sell the MQ-28 Ghost Bat fighter-like drone developed in Australia to the U.S. military, while the local arm of Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) this week unveiled plans for a smaller armed drone it also hopes to export.
Lockheed was selected last year alongside Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N) to accelerate the manufacture and delivery of guided weapons to Australia.
In-country assembly, and eventually manufacturing, are a focus of the project that aims to build local stockpiles, said Ken Kota, vice president of Lockheed's Australian defence strategic capabilities office.
""Manufacturing guided weapons in particular has its own deterrent effect,"" he said. ""It is very important for Australia to have this from a strategic standpoint.""

· To make buys once strategic review made public next month
· Eyeing local production of key items
AVALON, Australia, March 2 (Reuters) - As close U.S. ally Australia gears up to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, global defence contractors this week showed off advanced drones, long-range missiles and military communications satellites at its biggest air show.
The firms are pushing for billions of dollars' worth of purchases expected after Australia's long-awaited defence strategic review (DSR) is made public next month, setting out the force structure and equipment required over the next decade.
Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said securing long-range strike weapons in three to five years should be the priority given China's growing threat to Taiwan and the high likelihood of Australia joining the U.S. in a fight.
""When the DSR comes out there will be diplomatic language that doesn't necessarily squarely target China by name, but I think everyone gets the reality this has been driven by China, its rapid growth and its military capabilities,"" he said on the sidelines of the Australian International Airshow near Melbourne.
Like other countries, Australia is also focusing increasingly on securing more local production and supply stocks after observing the depletions caused by the war in Ukraine.
The government's aim is to ""speed up the acquisition cycle"" and move as quickly as possible once the review is public, Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy told reporters on Wednesday. The federal budget is due in May and the defence allocation is expected to grow.
At the air show, some defence contractors privately expressed frustration that the tightly held review ordered last August, three months after a new centre-left government took office, had slowed down procurement and delivery times.
Major decisions in the balance from the review include whether to order another squadron of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jets, up to four more Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drones and a major military satellite contract being pursued by five groups, including Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N).
""Everyone is reading the tea leaves, but we know a lot of capability will be coming out of that DSR,"" said Stephen Forshaw, Airbus's chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.
Australia ranked 12th globally in military spending in 2021 at $31.8 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It is a major buyer of U.S. equipment in particular, having operated alongside the U.S. in conflicts around the world. In 2021, it formed an alliance with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered submarines.
The air show also highlighted how Australia's smaller force is influencing U.S. purchases. Australia has operated Boeing E-7A airborne early warning and control planes since 2009, as the first customer for the type. The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it planned to buy 26 of them to replace its ageing E-3s.
Boeing is also looking to sell the MQ-28 Ghost Bat fighter-like drone developed in Australia to the U.S. military, while the local arm of Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) this week unveiled plans for a smaller armed drone it also hopes to export.
Lockheed was selected last year alongside Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N) to accelerate the manufacture and delivery of guided weapons to Australia.
In-country assembly, and eventually manufacturing, are a focus of the project that aims to build local stockpiles, said Ken Kota, vice president of Lockheed's Australian defence strategic capabilities office.
""Manufacturing guided weapons in particular has its own deterrent effect,"" he said. ""It is very important for Australia to have this from a strategic standpoint.""

Food deliveryman gets jail for harassing debtors after borrowing from loan sharks to pay for friends' meals,"The offender also threw items, including a TV, from height and the judge said this was an example of short-term thinking without realising the long-term consequences.
SINGAPORE: A food deliveryman borrowed from loan sharks to fund his habit of paying for his friends' meals and later helped the illegal moneylenders harass debtors to pay off his debt.
When his mother refused to ask his aunt for money, he threw a television set and a wooden bench down from a sixth-floor flat.

Abu Zar Ghifari Tarmudi, 36, was sentenced to two years and eight months' jail, and 12 strokes of the cane on Thursday (Mar 2).
He pleaded guilty to six charges including offences related to loan shark harassment as well as a rash act endangering human life.
The court heard that Abu earned a daily salary of S$80 to S$100 as a food deliveryman.
In June 2022, he started borrowing from loan sharks to fund his habit of paying for his friends' meals.
He started to default on the payments and ignored the loan sharks, even though they harassed and threatened him and his family.
On Aug 30, 2022, he argued with his mother in their sixth-floor flat in Punggol because she refused to help him ask his aunt for money.
In the heat of the moment, he threw three cups, a flask, a bowl, a television set and a wooden bench out of the living room window.
Abu was charged for this offence in September 2022.
OFFENDED WHILE ON BAIL
A month later, while out on bail, he tried to borrow money from another loan shark known as Darren.
Darren said Abu had outstanding loans of about S$3,000 owed to other loan sharks, so he told him that he would not loan him any money.
Instead, Darren offered Abu a job to harass debtors for him. Abu would be paid S$150 for every house he threw paint at, and S$200 for every house he threw paint at on top of locking their gate.
Abu accepted this offer to clear his debts.
Over two days in October 2022, he harassed debtors in various ways including splashing paint at their doors and locking their gates.
In particular, he hung a piece of raw pork on the gate of a unit that had a Muslim occupant.
JUDGE QUESTIONS HIM
In court on Thursday, District Judge Eddy Tham asked Abu why he hung raw pork at the unit.
Abu, who was remanded, claimed that he was forced to as a loan shark had sent ""pork rice"" to his mother's home.
The prosecutor sought between 30 and 32 months' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for Abu.
He was sentenced in 2013 for a similar charge of a rash act endangering human life, and reoffended while on bail.
Abu said he regretted his mistakes and would not repeat them again.
Judge Tham told him that the rash act offence was ""particularly egregious"" as bulky items were thrown from height.
""The consequences would've been tragic if these objects landed on any innocent passer-by below,"" he said. ""You are more culpable in that you had already been jailed before for a similar offence and that did not deter you.""
He said that Abu was not able to afford ""this kind of lifestyle treating your friends"", and said this was an example of ""short-term thinking without realising the long-term consequences"".

"Kranji water reclamation plant, NEWater factory to be redeveloped to raise treatment capacities","SINGAPORE: Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and Kranji NEWater Factory will be redeveloped by around 2035 to meet Singapore’s projected increase in water consumption.
Announcing the plan on Thursday (Mar 2) alongside other measures, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said during the Committee of Supply debate that the preliminary design of the Kranji facilities will start this year.
Singapore consumes about 440 million gallons of water per day currently, but the amount is expected to almost double by 2065.
Kranji Water Reclamation Plant was constructed in the 1980s and serves developments in the north, such as Woodlands, Sungei Kadut and Choa Chu Kang. The plant treats used water for further reclamation at Kranji NEWater factory to provide NEWater or for discharge to the sea.
The redevelopment of both facilities will cater to an expected increase in used water to be collected and treated due to upcoming major residential and industrial developments in the north, such as Tengah and the Sungei Kadut Eco-District.
The new plant will have a membrane bioreactor – a combination of conventional bioreactors, secondary sedimentation tanks and filtration into one single step, according to the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and water agency PUB in a joint media release.
The technology uses a smaller footprint than conventional treatment, while producing a higher quality effluent that can cut short the existing NEWater treatment process.
It will also adopt thermal hydrolysis process technology, which improves sludge management for disposal and increases the biogas for energy recovery.
The plant will be connected to the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, completing Singapore’s three-node system for water reclamation, with Changi Water Reclamation Plant in the east and Tuas Water Reclamation Plant in the west.
The sewerage system is currently under construction in phases, with phase 1 - conveying used water from the eastern part of Singapore to Changi Water Reclamation Plant - completed.
PUB said it is ""making good progress"" on phase 2, which will serve the western part of Singapore. Tunnelling works are expected to finish by the second half of this year.
NEW RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES
From Jan 1 next year, water-intensive industries – wafer fabrication, electronics and biomedical – will have to meet new water recycling requirements. ""They are water-intensive and have high potential for water recycling,"" Ms Fu said in announcing the mandatory requirements.
A minimum 50 per cent recycling rate will be set for wafer fabrication plants involved in front-end semiconductor manufacturing. The median recycling rate among existing wafer fabrication plants is currently at 43 per cent, according to PUB. For electronics and biomedical plants, the recycling of specified wastewater streams will be made compulsory.
According to PUB, the three industries are among the largest water users in Singapore, accounting for 17 per cent of non-domestic water demand, or water consumption not by households. The new recycling requirements will enable Singapore to achieve water savings of 9 million gallons of water per day - the equivalent of 15 Olympic-sized swimming pools daily - from 2035, said the PUB.
The requirements apply to new projects that consume at least 60,000 cubic metres of water annually, and that submit planning applications from January 2024. Ongoing projects and those that have already submitted or will submit applications before 2024 will not be affected.
Companies implementing water recycling projects to meet the new mandatory recycling requirements have until end-2025 to apply for financial support from PUB’s Water Efficiency Fund and Industrial Water Solutions Demonstration Fund.
PUB is also reviewing its funding framework and looking at providing more incentives for companies to achieve recycling rates above the minimum 50 per cent, with details to be made available in the coming months.
S$125 MILLION RESEARCH PROGRAMME FOR COASTAL PROTECTION, FLOOD MANAGEMENT
Separately, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon announced the launch of a new research programme to tackle the issue of rising sea levels due to climate change.
The S$125 million Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme – to be funded under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan – is Singapore’s first and aims to strengthen coastal protection and inland flood management capabilities by advancing knowledge in these areas.
Sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1m by 2100, with more extreme storms and higher rainfall resulting in an increase in flood risks.
PUB was appointed national coastal protection agency in April 2020 and the statutory board has since been conducting coastal protection studies to prepare Singapore for the impact of sea-level rise.
Under the programme, a new Centre of Excellence will be set up at the National University of Singapore. It will conduct research in the areas of advance coastal science; enhance capabilities in monitoring, prediction and digitalisation of Singapore's coastal environment; and develop an effective framework to support integrated and adaptive planning.

:FIFA's appointment of supermodel Adriana Lima as its global fan ambassador in a Women's World Cup year is ""baffling"" and sends the wrong message to players and fans, former FIFA Council member Moya Dodd said.
Brazilian Lima will ""develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives"" in her role as FIFA's first global fan ambassador, the governing body said in a statement on Monday.
Australian Dodd, a former international player who served on the committee for Australia and New Zealand's successful bid to co-host the World Cup, said the Lima's appointment less than five months before the tournament was ""tone deaf"".

FIFA appointment of supermodel Lima 'baffling' - ex-Council member Dodd,"March 2 (Reuters) - FIFA's appointment of supermodel Adriana Lima as its global fan ambassador in a Women's World Cup year is ""baffling"" and sends the wrong message to players and fans, former FIFA Council member Moya Dodd said.
Brazilian Lima will ""develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives"" in her role as FIFA's first global fan ambassador, the governing body said in a statement on Monday.
Australian Dodd, a former international player who served on the committee for Australia and New Zealand's successful bid to co-host the World Cup, said the Lima's appointment less than five months before the tournament was ""tone deaf"".
""At the outset, the model's public image looked an odd fit for an organisation that says it wants to empower girls and women,"" Dodd, one of the first women to serve on FIFA's decision-making body, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Wednesday.
""I asked whether the FIFA ambassador will be delivering messages on body image, wellbeing and healthy eating.
""What will this ambassador represent to the large and growing population of aspirational #womensfootball players and fans who love the game because (it) shows us what empowerment and equality can look like?""
FIFA and Lima's public relations agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dodd was a member of the FIFA Council from 2013 to 2016.
A prominent women's soccer advocate, Dodd represented Australia 24 times from 1986-95 and played in FIFA's women's invitational tournament in 1988, three years before the inaugural Women's World Cup.
""When a girl plays football, the world sees her differently,"" Dodd said. ""Instead of being complimented on her nice looks or her pretty dress, she is valued for her game-saving tackles and brilliant goal-scoring.
""She's admired for what she can do, rather than how she looks, putting her on a more equal footing with her brothers in a way that can alter the whole trajectory of her life's ambitions.

Vietnam Parliament elects Vo Van Thuong as new state president,"HANOI - Vietnam’s National Assembly on Thursday elected Mr Vo Van Thuong as the country’s new president, in a reshuffle of the country’s top leadership amid a sweeping anti-graft campaign.
In an extraordinary session, lawmakers confirmed Mr Thuong, 52, after the ruling Communist Party nominated him on Wednesday as president, a largely ceremonial role but one of the top four political positions in the South-east Asian nation.
Mr Thuong’s election follows the sudden dismissal in January of his predecessor Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who was blamed by the party for “violations and wrongdoing” by officials under his control, in what was seen as a major escalation of the country’s “blazing furnace” anti-corruption crackdown.
In his first speech to the Parliament as new president, Mr Thuong said he will “resolutely” continue the fight against corruption.
“I will be absolutely loyal to the fatherland, the people and the constitution, striving to fulfill the tasks assigned by the party, the state and the people,” Mr Thuong said in a statement that was broadcast on Vietnam’s state television.
Mr Thuong is the youngest member of the party’s Politburo, the country’s top decision-making body, but is considered a veteran of the party, having begun his political career at university in communist youth organisations.
He is widely regarded as being close to General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam’s most powerful figure, and the main architect of the party’s battle against corruption.
Mr Thuong was elected with 98.38 per cent of the votes, according to the Parliament’s online portal.

World counting on India to play central role: Bill Gates on innovation to address climate change,"Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates addresses the G20 Secretariat programme of ‘Building Resilient and Inclusive Economies: The Promise of Digital Public Infrastructure’, at Sushma Swaraj Bhawan, in New Delhi on Wednesday. | Photo Credit: ANI
Billionaire-philanthropist Bill Gates on Wednesday expressed concern over climate change and called for scientific innovations to address the problem, asking India to take the lead.
""It just gets worse somewhere slightly every year, but it's one of the hardest things to fix because modern economies throughout the globe are based on energy intensity and over 80% of this energy comes from burning hydrocarbons,"" he said.
Mr. Gates, co-chair and trustee of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was delivering the fifth Ramnath Goenka lecture on 'Creating an Equal World: Power of Innovation'. The event was organised by The Indian Express Group.
To address the problem of climate change, he said, the challenge is ""pretty incredible"" when it comes to creating solutions that are not just cheap but also reliable.
""I find these challenges exciting and I always see a chance for innovation if we can get young people and explain that challenge to them and get capital to them. Then I think innovation can help continue with the human progress,"" he said.
While the ""global innovation boom"" is taking on the tough problems of climate change, the world is ""counting on India to play a central role"", Mr. Gates said.
""You have got 700 million young people, you have educational institutions, it just gets stronger. So we need innovation from the whole world, but a lot specifically from India,"" he said.
""We are looking to India for a significant part of that so that we can overcome the world's great challenges,"" he added.
Mr. Gates noted that ""most of the emission"" contributing to heating comes from the rich countries and yet ""most of the damage"" will be in the middle income and lower income countries that are near the equator.
""So it's an incredible injustice,"" he said, adding, ""Even though it kind of creeps up on you, we need to act now in a very big way.""
Mr. Gates appreciated the works being done in the renewable energy sector in India.

Higher investment quantum among changes to scheme that grants PR status to eligible investors,"The changes to the Global Investor Programme (GIP) will help to strengthen support for local start-ups and create more jobs, said the Economic Development Board.

SINGAPORE: Individuals looking to apply for permanent residency (PR) under an investment programme will soon be required to invest much higher amounts in Singapore, as part of changes announced on Thursday (Mar 2) to generate “more spin-offs” for the economy.
Currently, the Global Investor Programme (GIP) grants PR status to eligible foreigners who invest at least S$2.5 million in a new or existing business, a GIP fund that invests in Singapore-based firms, or a new or existing single family office based here with at least S$200 million in assets under management.
Changes will be made to all three investment options from Mar 15, said the Economic Development Board (EDB) which administers the programme.
INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS
Applicants looking at the first option of investing in a new or existing business in Singapore will have to demonstrate an investment of at least S$10 million, inclusive of paid-up capital.
For the second option of GIP-select funds, the minimum investment required will go up to S$25 million. These funds will be selected based on a “holistic assessment” of factors such as track record and investment mandate in Singapore, said EDB.
The third option will require applicants to set up a Singapore-based single family office with at least S$200 million in assets under management.
Of which, a minimum of S$50 million must be deployed in any of these four investment categories – companies listed on exchanges licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), qualifying debt securities and certificates of deposit listed on MAS’ enquiry system, funds distributed by Singapore-licensed managers that are listed on MAS’ financial institutions directory, and private equity injection into non-listed, Singapore-based businesses.",2023-03-02 04:13:32.796000+00:00,"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--7k123xks--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2022/11/21/dsc_6008.jpg?itok=Yqek4Wx6",CNA,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/singapore-global-investor-programme-higher-investment-quantum-3317416,"Higher investment quantum among changes to scheme that grants PR status to eligible investorsThe changes to the Global Investor Programme (GIP) will help to strengthen support for local start-ups and create more jobs, said the Economic Development Board.

Property developer China Vanke raises nearly $500 mln in Hong Kong share sale,"HONG KONG/SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Major property developer China Vanke Ltd said on Thursday it had raised HK$3.92 billion ($499 million) in a share placement in Hong Kong, in the first test of investor appetite towards a mainland developer share sale in 2023.
State-backed Vanke said in a filing that it sold 300 million shares at HK$13.05 per share, versus their offer price range of between HK$12.93 to HK$13.20 apiece, according to the term sheets of the deal launched on Wednesday and seen by Reuters.
The pricing was at a 6.12% discount to Vanke's Wednesday close of HK$13.90.
Vanke shares fell as much as 5.3% to HK$13.16 early on Thursday, but narrowed losses to 3.7% by noon, versus a 0.5% fall in the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI).
The Shenzhen-based developer said it intended to use 60% of the proceeds to repay its outstanding overseas debt financing, and the rest to replenish working capital.
It added it will not use the proceeds for new domestic residential development projects.
Vanke has $971 million and $650 million dollar notes due in April and May, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
China's property sector has since mid-2021 been grappling with a liquidity crisis, with many developers defaulting on or delaying debt payments as they struggle to sell apartments and raise funds.
Vanke, seen by the market as a good quality developer, is among those with the largest onshore credit lines in place.
It has received approval to issue around 30 billion yuan ($4.35 billion) notes recently and is planning to sell up to 15 billion yuan new shares in Shenzhen, where it is dual-listed (000002.SZ).
JP Morgan said Vanke's placement, while not a ""total surprise"", came earlier than expected because it is in a blackout period prior to earnings announcement.
""We believe Vanke might have wanted to take advantage of the current window to place H-shares first, especially before a potential wave of placements in 2Q23,"" the investment bank said, adding it expected more equity-raising in the sector.
JP Morgan noted Vanke's placement price was one of the narrowest among recent such sales, where the average discount was 12-13%, and that it did not think the placement hinted Vanke was in distress as its financing activities have been smooth.
Vanke's share sale represented 13.6% of its enlarged H shares and 2.51% of its enlarged total share capital, including both shares issued in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
CLSA and Citi are the placing agents of the share sale.

Upbeat comments on Wednesday from Reckitt Benckiser (RKT.L), Nivea-maker Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE), Moncler (MONC.MI) and Puma (PUMG.DE) came after data showing China's factory sector grew in February at the fastest pace in more than a decade.
Beiersdorf Chief Executive Vincent Warnery said the company had seen the first signs of recovery in China and the global travel retail business, fuelled by the country's reopening.
""After a very volatile January, with traffic still heavily impacted by the release of COVID restrictions in December, we see a clear turnaround in retail sales starting in February,"" he said in a briefing for analysts.
""China is back to growth, not only online but also in brick and mortar.""
U.S. toothpaste-maker Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) executives said last week at an industry conference that travel in China is back to pre-pandemic levels and that it expects strong improvement in coming months. Colgate recently introduced new premium whitening toothpastes in China targeting affluent city dwellers.
""The second half of the year will be far better,"" said Yves Briantais, a marketing executive for Colgate's Asia-Pacific region.
Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), whose second-largest market is China, is carefully watching its high-end SK-II skincare line as China reopens, said finance chief Andre Schulten at the conference.
Beiersdorf's Warnery said growth in its premium La Prairie and cheaper Eucerin and Nivea skincare ranges was likely to be driven by Chinese demand. Tourism from China was helping sales in neighbouring Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Japan, he added.
Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen tablets, cold remedy Lemsip and Durex, saw a pick-up in China after a decline in volumes because of lockdowns.
""I have no doubt that the intimate wellness (business) in China is going to perform well,"" said interim CEO Nicandro Durante, referring to the division which includes KY Jelly and Durex condoms.
The upbeat comments echo those of other executives during earnings season, particularly from luxury labels which are banking on a strong rebound fuelled by Chinese shoppers drawing on savings built up during pandemic lockdowns.
Upmarket U.S. companies including Coach handbag maker Tapestry Inc (TPR.N) and Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) last month recently said demand had started picking up in China.
""We certainly have seen a meaningful trend change in Greater China,"" Tapestry Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said last month, while Ralph Lauren executives said they were seeing traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores surge.
""We expect China to come back resiliently in the quarter,"" Ralph Lauren's operating chief Jane Nielsen said.
Resilient sales in China would be a relief for companies struggling with higher energy and wage costs, particularly in Europe, at the same time as rising prices of food, energy and rents are forcing consumers to be pickier about what they buy.
Stronger signs that Chinese factories are rebounding after COVID restrictions were lifted late last year could also temper an expected downturn in the global economy, as the U.S. Federal Reserve stays on its higher-for-longer interest rate path.
U.S. retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N), which operates nearly 400 retail and wholesale stores in China, reported strong traffic in its stores since reopening.
""We have seen people returning more to stores, which is what you would expect, and also wanting to celebrate events,"" Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said on a call last week.
GROWING CONFIDENCE
Retailer shares rose across global equity markets on Wednesday, even as broader indexes gave back gains on more concerns about inflation.
Reckitt shares rose 1.5% in London, while shares in Moncler rose 3.3% after the Italian luxury group, known for its warm puffer jackets, reported a strong start to the year.
Chief marketing and operating officer Roberto Eggs told a call with analysts on Tuesday evening the company saw double-digit sales growth in China before and after the Lunar New Year holiday in January.
""We always look at the results two weeks before and one week after the Chinese New Year and the impact is really positive,"" he said.
Adding to growing confidence in the luxury sector, the company said it had seen no adverse effects on demand from a 10% price increase at the start of the winter season.
Reuters reported in February LVMH's (LVMH.PA) top fashion brand Louis Vuitton was expected to increase prices in China by as much as 20%.

"Changes to Global Investor Programme to further support start-ups, create jobs for Singaporeans","SINGAPORE - Changes will be made to the Global Investor Programme (GIP) to get foreign businessmen to invest more and hire more locals to qualify to become permanent residents under it.
These investors, including those keen to set up family offices here, will also have to channel more funds to the local financial system.
This was announced by the investment arm of Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB) on Thursday.
EDB is making these changes to selectively attract individuals with the ability to make an economic impact for Singapore, and the affinity to be more rooted here.
The changes to all three investment options under the programme will kick in from March 15.
The GIP was launched in 2004 and last revised in March 2020. This programme accords Permanent Resident status to eligible global investors who intend to drive their businesses and investment growth from Singapore.
It is part of the Government’s efforts to strengthen Singapore’s status as a key Asian node for high-growth tech companies and investment activities, grow existing and new industries, and create jobs for Singaporeans.
GIP investors will be encouraged to deploy more funds in the local financial system and generate more jobs for Singaporeans, including in finance, tax, fund management and the legal sector, EDB said.
These changes are part of the board’s ongoing review of the GIP to ensure the programme’s effectiveness in attracting only top-tier business owners who are interested to grow their businesses and investments from Singapore.
Under the first option, new investors who apply for the programme will be required to have invested at least S$10 million, inclusive of existing paid-up capital, in a new business entity or existing business operation in Singapore.
This is an increase from the previous S$2.5 million required. Applicants must also have hired minimally 30 employees, with at least half of them being Singapore Citizens and 10 of whom must be new employees, to be eligible for Re-entry Permit Renewal after the initial five-year period.
Under the second option, applicants will be required to invest S$25 million in a GIP-selected fund. These GIP-selected funds will be shortlisted by EDB based on a holistic assessment of their track record, investment mandate in Singapore, as well as the type of industries or markets the funds focus on.",2023-03-02 04:12:24.488000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/cbd039A8691_0.jpg?VersionId=9oE_ymmdPM1b81Pk11_ABp6YCT1_HMCV,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/changes-to-global-investor-programme-to-further-support-start-ups-create-jobs-for-singaporeans,"Changes to Global Investor Programme to further support start-ups, create jobs for SingaporeansSINGAPORE - Changes will be made to the Global Investor Programme (GIP) to get foreign businessmen to invest more and hire more locals to qualify to become permanent residents under it.

Biden challenged by softening public support for arming Ukraine,"WASHINGTON - When he made his surprise wartime trip to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv last week, US President Joe Biden reassured that country with great confidence that “the Americans stand with you.” But the question that remains unanswered is: For how long?
For all of the president’s bravado while he was abroad, the politics of Ukraine back home in the United States are shifting noticeably and, for the White House, worryingly. Polls show public support for arming the Ukrainians softening while the two leading Republican presidential candidates are increasingly speaking out against involvement in the war.
While the bipartisan coalition in Congress favouring Ukraine has been strong in the year since Russia’s invasion, supporters of more aid fear the centrifugal forces of the emerging presidential contest and growing taxpayer fatigue with shipping tens of billions of dollars overseas may undercut the war effort before Moscow can be defeated.
And some of them are frustrated that Mr Biden has not done more to shore up support.
The evolving dynamics were on full display this week when House Republicans, exercising the power of their new majority, pressed Pentagon officials at two hearings about spending on Ukraine, grilling them about where the money is going and vowing to hold them accountable.
Despite Mr Biden’s pledge, the Ukrainian government has grown concerned enough that President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to set up a telephone call with Speaker Kevin McCarthy to make his country’s case.
Overall, public support for Ukraine aid has fallen from 60 per cent last May to 48 per cent now, according to surveys by The Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research.
The share of Americans who think the United States has given too much to Ukraine has grown from 7 per cent a year ago to 26 per cent last month, according to the Pew Research Center.
And even supporters make clear their commitment is not without bounds. While 50 per cent of those surveyed by Fox News said US support should continue for “as long as it takes to win,” 46 per cent said the time frame should be limited.
“It’s this way with every foreign intervention,” said Mr Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist who has advised two outspoken Republican voices against Ukraine aid, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Mr Donald Trump Jr.
“In the first few months, it’s always popular. People don’t like what Russia did; it’s awful. But as time goes on, war weariness is a real thing, especially in this country, especially when voters aren’t connecting what’s happening in Ukraine with their own security.”
Although scepticism of Ukraine aid has grown on both sides of the aisle, the party breakdown has been striking.
According to Pew, 40 per cent of Republicans think too much has been given compared with 15 per cent of Democrats. The good news for Mr Biden is that Americans have grown more supportive of his handling of the war, with 48 per cent approving of his response to the invasion in the Fox poll compared with 40 per cent in August.
While Mr Biden used his visit to Kyiv and a follow-up stop in Warsaw, Poland, to express solidarity with the Ukrainians, he has talked less about the war to fellow Americans while at home.
He made a relatively passing reference to the war during his State of the Union address and has focused mainly on domestic priorities in recent campaign-style stops around the country. In part, that may be intended to deflect criticism that he cares more about foreigners than Americans.
Aides said Mr Biden’s speeches in Kyiv and Warsaw were intended for an American audience as well as international ones.
But the president has shrugged off concerns about ebbing public support for the Ukraine supply effort, suggesting it is relegated mainly to what he calls Maga Republicans, after former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan.
Mr John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said support remains powerful in Congress itself.
“Yes, there are a small number of members on Capitol Hill, in the House Republicans specifically, that have expressed publicly their concerns about support for Ukraine,” he said at a recent briefing. “But if you talk to the House leadership, you won’t hear that. And you certainly aren’t going to hear it on the Democratic side. And you don’t hear it in the Senate.”
Indeed, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and key House Republicans like Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have pushed Mr Biden from the other side, arguing that the president is not doing enough for Ukraine.
Mr McCaul took a congressional delegation to Kyiv shortly after Mr Biden, emphasising bipartisan support.
But Mr McCarthy, who during last fall’s campaign said there would be no “blank cheque” for Ukraine in a Republican House, is under pressure from a small but vocal part of his caucus critical of the US’ involvement in the war and encouraged by Fox News’ Mr Tucker Carlson.
With a razor-thin working majority, it is not clear whether he would allow another robust aid package to come to the floor for a vote and, if so, under what conditions, which is why Mr Zelensky wants to talk, as was reported by Punchbowl News.
Among those pushing Mr McCarthy to block future aid is Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former QAnon adherent who has become a key ally since helping him win the speakership.
Speaking to Just the News, a conservative website, this week, Ms Greene said she opposed the war in Ukraine. “But you know who’s driving it?” she asked. “It’s America. America needs to stop pushing the war in Ukraine.”
While she and her allies have been on the margins of the Republican Party on Ukraine, the centre of gravity may be shifting.
Mr Trump lashed out at Mr Biden last week for visiting Kyiv instead of East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a recent toxic train derailment. In a fundraising video, Mr Trump said, “We’re teetering on the brink of World War III” thanks to Mr Biden and promised to “end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours.”
Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, his most formidable potential challenger for the 2024 nomination, sought to match Mr Trump, criticising what he called the “open-ended blank cheque” for Ukraine and saying “I don’t think it’s in our interest” to be involved in the fight for territory seized by Russia.
By contrast, the announced and unannounced Republican presidential candidates who do support aid to Ukraine, like former Vice-President Mike Pence and Ms Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, trail far behind those two front-runners.
So far, Congress has approved US$113 billion (S$151.94 billion) in military, economic, humanitarian and other aid for Ukraine, not all of which has been spent.
Anticipating trouble from the new Republican House, the White House and Democratic majority last winter pushed through an aid package large enough to last until summer. At the current rate of spending, it would run out by mid-July, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
A House Democrat who asked not to be identified speaking critically of the White House expressed concern that the president’s team did not fully grasp how Americans viewed the aid.
While they support Ukraine in principle, this Democrat said, the way the aid has been doled out through a steady drumbeat of announcements of another US$500 million or US$1 billion every week or two exacerbates the sense that endless funds are heading out of the country.
Mr Philip Zelikow, a University of Virginia scholar and former State Department counsellor, said military aid was more popular than economic aid because much of it is actually spent on arms produced by US defence firms.
But he said that economic aid was critical to rebuilding Ukraine, and he argued that seizing US$300 billion in Russian assets in the West for reconstruction would ease the burden on the American taxpayer.
“I’m critical of the administration because it did not start moving at least six months ago to design a more sustainable and hopeful strategy on what will likely be the decisive battlefield of the war,” he said.
Still, some government veterans said there is only so much Mr Biden can do to preserve public support, since the most pronounced erosion has been on the Republican side.
“President Biden probably has limited ability to reach the Republican audiences that are most in play,” said Professor Peter Feaver, a Duke University academic who has studied the relationship between public opinion and military operations and advised President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. “He has a daunting but perhaps doable task to keep his left flank on board.” NYTIMES",2023-03-02 04:12:24.486000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/US-PEOPLE-ACROSS-NORTH-AMERICA-GATHER-TO-SUPPORT-UKRAINE-ON-THE-001206.jpg?VersionId=U2R3UeAe0iwp3jz4BM_LkU8x9jZ9WEQw,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/biden-challenged-by-softening-public-support-for-arming-ukraine,"Biden challenged by softening public support for arming UkraineWASHINGTON - When he made his surprise wartime trip to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv last week, US President Joe Biden reassured that country with great confidence that “the Americans stand with you.” But the question that remains unanswered is: For how long?

3 years’ jail for ex-property agent who made off with client’s money and caused over $1m loss,"SINGAPORE - A property agent, engaged to help in the purchase of a condominium unit, misappropriated nearly $600,000 of her client’s money meant for parties including the property developer.
This led to a failure to complete the purchase under an option to purchase (OTP) agreement, despite time extensions.
The developer then exercised its right to terminate the OTP and forfeited nearly $1.2 million of payments, which the client had earlier made. To date, the client has not been able to recover the amount.
The offender, Liu Siyu, 32, was sentenced to three years’ jail on Thursday. She pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count each of criminal breach of trust involving nearly $343,000 and forgery.
Another criminal breach of trust charge involving the remaining amount was considered during sentencing.
Both Liu and the 32-year-old client are Chinese nationals. The prosecution said that Liu was a property agent with ERA Realty Network from 2015 to 2017.
Her name could not be found on the Council for Estate Agencies’ public register in an online search on Thursday.
Liu, who is a Singapore permanent resident, first met the client some time before 2015 when they were studying in Britain.
In November 2015, the client and her father engaged Liu as a property agent to represent them in the purchase of a unit at The Crest condominium in Prince Charles Crescent near Alexandra Road.
As the unit that cost $1,785,000 was under construction at the time, the father-and-daughter pair were to pay developer Wingcrown Investment in instalments, based on a payment schedule in a sale and purchase agreement (SPA).
The client would then transfer funds for the unit’s purchase to Liu’s bank account. Liu was tasked to use the monies to pay the developer on her client’s behalf.
Initially, Liu paid the first 40 per cent of the purchase price to the developer on time.
She was also timely in paying $315,900 to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for items such as the buyer’s stamp duty.
Liu later began to fall behind in payments to the developer, leading to a shortfall of nearly $343,000 between Sept 14, 2016 and March 31, 2018.
Within that period, Liu dishonestly misappropriated the amount and used her ill-gotten gains to buy Louis Vuitton, Christian Louboutin and Hermes luxury goods.
Due to the non-payment of several items of the payment schedule, the SPA was annulled on March 12, 2018.
Accordingly, the developer forfeited $379,195.58 from the progress payments made for the property purchase up to that point, with a balance sum of $838,354.42 to be refunded to the client and her father.
Following negotiations to continue with the property’s purchase via a private treaty sale, the developer issued a fresh OTP to the pair dated April 17, 2018.
Among other things, the unit’s price was increased to $1.9 million and the purchase had to be completed by June 26, 2018.
During this time, the client instructed Liu to issue cashier’s orders for the purchase.
On five occasions between April 2 and 27, 2018, Liu used messaging application WeChat to send the client images of cashier’s orders, each for between $35,700 and $442,500. But checks later revealed that these cashier’s orders did not exist.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Chew said: “The accused subsequently admitted that these were fake cashier’s orders that she had created by editing images of cashier’s orders with her handphone.
“The accused admitted that she did so to stop (the cient) from chasing her to make payment for the property purchase.”
On Nov 20, 2018, due to a failure to complete the property purchase under the OTP despite time extensions, the developer forfeited nearly $1.2 million from the payments that the client had made up to that point.
Court documents did not disclose how Liu’s offences were discovered, but she made full restitution of nearly $600,000 in 2019.
Defence lawyer Riyach Hussain told the court on Tuesday that his client is remorseful.
Liu’s bail was set at $15,000 on Thursday, and she is expected to surrender herself at the State Courts on April 3 to begin serving her sentence.",2023-03-02 04:12:24.485000+00:00,,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/3-years-jail-for-ex-property-agent-who-made-off-with-client-s-money-and-caused-over-1m-loss,"3 years’ jail for ex-property agent who made off with client’s money and caused over $1m lossSINGAPORE - A property agent, engaged to help in the purchase of a condominium unit, misappropriated nearly $600,000 of her client’s money meant for parties including the property developer.
This led to a failure to complete the purchase under an option to purchase (OTP) agreement, despite time extensions.
The developer then exercised its right to terminate the OTP and forfeited nearly $1.2 million of payments, which the client had earlier made. To date, the client has not been able to recover the amount.
The offender, Liu Siyu, 32, was sentenced to three years’ jail on Thursday. She pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count each of criminal breach of trust involving nearly $343,000 and forgery.
Another criminal breach of trust charge involving the remaining amount was considered during sentencing.

Government to publish annual report on public sector’s sustainability efforts,"SINGAPORE - From the 2023 financial year (FY), the Government will publish an annual report to track the public sector’s efforts, progress and plans in rolling out its sustainability agenda, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Thursday.
Under the GreenGov.Sg initiative, the public sector will strive for ambitious sustainability targets, and to be a positive influence and enabler of green efforts.
Ms Fu said that the Government will start with reporting its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, electricity and water consumption, with reference to international standards and frameworks.
Scope 1 emissions refer to a company or entity’s direct emissions - such as emissions from a company’s fleet vehicles like cars and trucks, while Scope 2 emissions refer to indirect ones, such as greenhouse gas emissions purchased from an electricity producer that is generated off-site.
Ms Fu said that from FY2024, all statutory boards will also make their annual environmental sustainability disclosures.
She noted that several statutory boards have started doing so. These include the Monetary Authority of Singapore, National Environmental Agency, PUB, Maritime Port Authority and Sentosa Development Corporation.
“They have been systematically incorporating sustainability in their decision-making and risk management frameworks to achieve concrete sustainability outcomes,” said Ms Fu.
Elaborating on how the public sector can drive the nation’s transition to a green economy by leveraging on its procurement budget, Ms Fu said that starting from 2024, the Government will start considering the
sustainability practices of the company that it purchases from.
Therefore, starting with large construction and ICT tenders, up to 5 per cent of evaluation points will be set aside for environmental sustainability considerations, such as the carbon footprint of a company, whether it has adopted low-carbon solutions, or minimised the amount of packaging materials.
She noted that both sectors make up more than 60 per cent of the value of Government procurement contracts.
Some examples of construction projects include business parks, industrial buildings, larger roads, and MRT projects.
“We will review the (5 per cent) amount and engage the industry closely as we expand the adoption of sustainability criteria to more public sector procurement sectors,” said Ms Fu.
She stressed that environmental sustainability is not without cost, and consumers would have to be ready to pay a bit more for greener goods and services.
“Green procurement in the public sector will encourage suppliers to adopt sustainability practices and develop greener products and services,” said Ms Fu.
“I hope that these initiatives under GreenGov.SG will spur many in the private sector to follow suit, in publishing their own sustainability reports, and incorporating sustainability considerations in their procurement policies,” she added.",2023-03-02 04:12:24.485000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/yaohui-pixgeneric-1102_1.jpg?VersionId=lCoLtzsUPW0le6HUfTcF_nwsopMbdNB2,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/government-to-publish-annual-report-on-public-sector-s-sustainability-efforts,"Government to publish annual report on public sector’s sustainability effortsSINGAPORE - From the 2023 financial year (FY), the Government will publish an annual report to track the public sector’s efforts, progress and plans in rolling out its sustainability agenda, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Thursday.

Australia to probe businesses over claims of sustainable practices and products,"SYDNEY - Australia’s competition regulator said on Thursday it would investigate a number of businesses for potential exaggeration of claims of environment-friendly investment and products after a review of 247 businesses found a concerning trend.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said about 57 per cent of the businesses across eight sectors reviewed during the sweep were identified as having made “concerning claims” about their environmental credentials.
The ACCC listed vague and unidentified claims, lack of substantiating information, use of absolute claims and comparisons, and exaggerating benefits or omitting relevant information as some of the key concerns found.
The sweep, which took place between early to mid-October last year, comes just two days after the country’s corporate regulator launched legal action against pension fund Mercer Superannuation, accusing it of misleading members about the sustainability of some of its investment options.
The court action against Mercer is the first of its kind and comes at a time when environment-friendly investment and products garner more attention with rising interest in sustainable and ethical investment options.
Among businesses reviewed by the ACCC, cosmetic, clothing and footwear and food and drink sectors were found to have the highest proportion of concerning claims, with other sectors also making a “significant proportion” of concerning claims, it said.
“Our sweep indicates a significant proportion of businesses are making vague or unclear environmental claims. This warrants further scrutiny,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said in a statement on Thursday.
“It appears that rather than making legitimate changes to their practices and procedures, some businesses are relying on false or misleading claims.”
The regulator will conduct further analysis of the issues and will undertake enforcement, compliance, and education activities where appropriate, it said in its detailed report.

"Court settles contested sale of S$838,888 condo unit bought by man and his mistress as investment","The businessman said he owned a few properties at the time and wanted to avoid paying high stamp duty fees, so the property was purchased in his mistress' name instead.
Screengrab from Google Street View of Parkview Apartments in Bukit Batok.
SINGAPORE: A man who bought a condominium unit for S$838,888 with his mistress in 2014, intending to sell it for shared profit in the future, turned to court to have the sale go through after their relationship fizzled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mr Ng Hong Khiang, who was a businessman at the time, argued that the Parkview Apartment property should be sold and that he should retain 30.24 per cent of the sale proceeds, which was his contribution towards the purchase.
The property is registered wholly in the name of Ms Wu Cuiyun, Mr Ng's former mistress.
Ms Wu contested the sale, saying that whatever money Mr Ng had paid for the purchase price and costs of the property were a ""betrothal gift"" or eventual wedding present to her.
After considering the evidence, Justice Tan Siong Thye ordered in a judgment published on Lawnet on Thursday (Mar 2) that the property be sold, with 15.4 per cent of the proceeds paid to Mr Ng.
THE CASE
Mr Ng, who was represented by lawyers Adrian Wee and Lynette Chang from Lighthouse Law, sought an order from the court to sell the 1 Bukit Batok Street property.
He first met Ms Wu in 2010, when Ms Wu was working for him at a KTV lounge. They entered into a romantic relationship around 2011, when both parties were married to other people.
Ms Wu later divorced her husband. In 2014, Ms Wu and Mr Ng agreed to buy the condo unit, which had a purchase price of S$838,888.
Ms Wu, who was represented by Mr Baburam Dayalan Naidu from H.A. & Chung Partnership, does not dispute the payments of about S$273,000 that Mr Ng made for the property.
These include S$166,943.60 in a cheque for the cash component of the condo's purchase price and S$61,710 for stamp duties payable.
Ms Wu obtained a mortgage loan from a bank for S$630,000 in her name secured on the property. She has also been making monthly mortgage repayments to the bank.
According to Mr Ng, he owned a few properties at the time and wanted to avoid paying high stamp duty fees, so the property was purchased in Ms Wu's name instead.
Mr Ng, who is now in his 50s, argued that the pair had entered into an oral agreement before the purchase of the property.
The agreement included terms that both parties would contribute money to invest in the property, that Mr Ng would fund the cash component of the purchase price, stamp duties and legal costs for the purchase, as well as maintenance fees.
Another term of the agreement was that the property would be sold if either of them wanted to, with the sale proceeds divided in the proportion of their contributions to the purchase price and costs of the property.
MS WU'S CLAIM
In response, Ms Wu said there was no such oral agreement. Instead, she said Mr Ng's contributions were ""a gift"" to her, made because of their long intimate relationship and in consideration of all the years they had been together.
Ms Wu also said that because Mr Ng was married at the time, he knew he could not marry her. Therefore, Mr Ng told her that his contribution was intended to be a ""betrothal gift"" or wedding present to her, as Mr Ng had accepted that there would be a day when they would no longer be in a relationship.
She contested Mr Ng's claim that he had contributed about S$273,000. Instead, she said she gave two separate sums of S$130,000 and S$4,000 to him to pay for the purchase price and costs of the property.
Therefore, his contributions amount to only S$139,098, she said.
After hearing the evidence, Justice Tan found that Mr Ng had succeeded in making his case that the pair had agreed to buy the property together and sell it later at either party's requests, splitting the proceeds in proportion to their respective contributions.
He rejected Ms Wu's claims that the money Mr Ng had paid to her for the property was merely a gift.
She had changed her account from stating that it was a ""gift"" to saying it was her ""dowry"" if she got married one day.
The WeChat messages between the pair in February 2022 also showed no indication that the property was a gift, said the judge.
THE S$130,000
However, he found that Mr Ng had contributed only S$139,098 to the property because of the S$130,000 Ms Wu said she had given to Mr Ng.
Mr Ng had claimed that this amount was actually his money that he had given Ms Wu for safekeeping in the course of their relationship.
He claimed that sometime from the early or mid-2012 to the end of 2013, he gave Ms Wu S$5,000 in cash each month for safekeeping.
He did so to conceal his income from his wife and to set aside money for himself in the event he wished to make large purchases or investments. Therefore, when Ms Wu issued cheques totalling S$130,000 to him, she was just ""returning"" his money.
The judge rejected this argument, saying the numbers did not add up, and that it was inconsistent with his earlier affidavit, leading him to disbelieve Mr Ng.
Instead, the evidence showed that Ms Wu had given him S$130,000 for the property.

Most supermarkets in Singapore will charge 5 cents for each plastic bag from July 3,"SINGAPORE - People will soon be paying more for plastic, with most supermarkets set to charge at least five cents per bag by July 3.
The move, part of efforts to reduce the use of disposables in Singapore, comes in tandem with efforts to ramp up recycling efforts in homes.
About 400 major supermarkets - or two-thirds of all outlets here - will charge for disposable shopping bags. They include NTUC FairPrice, Cold Storage, Giant, Sheng Siong and Prime supermarket stores.
Disposable carrier bags of other material types will also carry a charge.
While the price on disposable bags was first announced in 2022, the July 3 start date was announced by Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor in Parliament on Thursday.
Speaking during the debate on the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment’s (MSE) budget, Dr Khor said: “Following consultations with supermarket operators, we understand that the majority will be charging five cents per bag, and this would moderate potential cost impact on consumers. We can avoid the charge by bringing our own reusable bags.”
In a joint statement, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and MSE said: “Whether they are made of paper, plastic or degradable materials, disposables have an impact on our environment during their production, transportation and disposal.”
Since all disposable bags in Singapore are either recycled or incinerated before being thrown into the landfill, biodegradable bags - which have already turned to ash - cannot naturally degrade here. Biodegradable bags are also not necessarily recyclable.
Supermarket chains can proceed with the bag charge before July 3, if they wish to.
A number of smaller retailers and some supermarkets have already been voluntarily charging for plastic and paper shopping bags. These include The Body Shop, H&M, Guardian, Watsons, 7-Eleven, 11 FairPrice outlets and 178 Cheers and FairPrice Xpress stores.
Similar schemes in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have led to a drop in plastic bags used by 60 per cent to 90 per cent, said Dr Khor.
The authorities will monitor the effectiveness of the bag charge at supermarkets from July and assess the need to expand mandatory coverage to other stores in the future, she added.
To spread the word about the upcoming carrier bag charge at supermarkets and encourage shoppers to switch to reusable bags, environmental group Zero Waste SG has been running weekend roadshows at different supermarkets since Feb 11.

The move, part of efforts to reduce the use of disposables in Singapore, comes in tandem with efforts to ramp up recycling efforts in homes.
About 400 major supermarkets - or two-thirds of all outlets here - will charge for disposable shopping bags. They include NTUC FairPrice, Cold Storage, Giant, Sheng Siong and Prime supermarket stores.
Disposable carrier bags of other material types will also carry a charge.
While the price on disposable bags was first announced in 2022, the July 3 start date was announced by Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor in Parliament on Thursday.
Speaking during the debate on the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment’s (MSE) budget, Dr Khor said: “Following consultations with supermarket operators, we understand that the majority will be charging five cents per bag, and this would moderate potential cost impact on consumers. We can avoid the charge by bringing our own reusable bags.”
In a joint statement, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and MSE said: “Whether they are made of paper, plastic or degradable materials, disposables have an impact on our environment during their production, transportation and disposal.”
Since all disposable bags in Singapore are either recycled or incinerated before being thrown into the landfill, biodegradable bags - which have already turned to ash - cannot naturally degrade here. Biodegradable bags are also not necessarily recyclable.
Supermarket chains can proceed with the bag charge before July 3, if they wish to.

Japanese ‘peer pressure’ may prevent return to pre-Covid life: Yomiuri Shimbun contributor,"TOKYO - Perhaps you’ve heard the old joke about a luxury cruise ship that was about to sink.
Urging the passengers to abandon ship by jumping into the sea, the ship’s captain appealed to each of them by playing on national stereotypes.
To an American passenger, he said, “If you jump in now, you will be a hero.” To a German, he said: “You have to jump in. It’s a rule.” To a French passenger, “Never jump in!”
And to a Japanese passenger, he said, “Everyone else has already jumped in.”
Japanese tend to look around and read the atmosphere rather than stick to their own opinions. It can be said that it is part of the national character to place greater emphasis on group cooperation. This national character is also evident in the response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has continued for about three years since 2020.
While other countries imposed mandatory lockdowns, the Japanese government merely asked people to refrain from unnecessarily leaving their homes.
Many Japanese diligently obeyed the government’s request and stayed at home. There was some reaction against the government’s policies, but Japan experienced virtually none of the large-scale demonstrations and riots that were triggered by dissatisfaction with lockdowns in other parts of the world.
Japanese society has strong “peer pressure” that implicitly forces people to conform to the opinions of the majority. Peer pressure is not always negative or coercive. In some cases, it can be a positive force for social support and encouragement.
However, peer pressure is beginning to backfire at a time when the spread of the coronavirus is gradually coming to an end and people are considering how to return to their pre-Covid lifestyles.
On Feb 10, the Japanese government announced that, in principle, it will “leave it up to the individual” to decide whether to wear a mask from March 13. The previous rule requiring the wearing of masks indoors will be relaxed.
At the same time, the government also stated that, to prevent infections among the elderly and other people, it recommends the use of masks in medical institutions and crowded trains as an exception.
Also, the government decided not to require the wearing of masks at school graduation ceremonies scheduled throughout Japan in March. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: “Children have worn masks for three years. I hope they will participate in their graduation ceremony with smiles on their faces.”
The Japanese government’s announcement that it will leave the wearing of masks to individuals’ decisions is likely to raise questions from people outside of Japan. “The decision to wear a mask is a personal one, so why should the government tell me what I can and cannot do?”
The reaction in Japan, however, is different.
“We are puzzled when the government tells us that wearing a mask is entirely a personal decision,” Tottori Gov. Shinji Hirai, president of the National Governors’ Association, said in an exchange of views with Health, Labour and Welfare Minister Katsunobu Kato.
Hirai asked the government to carefully explain the standards for wearing masks, saying, “I want the government to coordinate with those in the field on effective mask-wearing and infection control measures, and to provide evidence-based guidance to people and businesses.”
Even the heads of local governments have requested that the central government provide a certain amount of direction. They say that unless someone sets the rules, it will be difficult to end mask-wearing.
In a Yomiuri Shimbun poll conducted in February, 60 per cent of respondents said they would like to wear masks as much as possible, and 34 per cent said they want to go maskless as much as possible.
However, we should be a little careful in interpreting the results of this poll as meaning that “the majority of Japanese want to continue wearing masks.” The reality is that they would like to take off their masks if possible, but they are probably reluctant to suddenly take off the masks they have worn almost every day for the past three years.
Among young Japanese, a new term has been coined: “kao pantsu,” which literally means “face underwear.” The expression suggests that masks, like underwear, cannot be decently removed. Taking off one’s mask and exposing one’s face to the world is like taking off one’s underwear in public.
A common sentiment among Japanese people is that they are hesitant to remove their own masks because they are concerned about how they will be viewed by those around them. This is a real-life version of the peer pressure that pushes Japanese passengers to jump into the sea from that luxury cruise ship.
The wearing of masks for Japanese people has a different meaning than it does for foreigners, especially Westerners.
Even before the pandemic, the wearing of masks was a routine practice to prevent colds and hay fever. For the most part, it was simply a considerate way to protect others by keeping any virus from spreading. In contrast, many Americans before the pandemic perceived masks as medical supplies for people who are seriously ill.
For the Japanese, it is extremely difficult to know when to take off their masks, as it is at least partly a matter of etiquette. In his October 2022 policy speech, Prime Minister Kishida stated: “In principle, masks are unnecessary outdoors. Unless you are talking close together, you do not need to wear a mask outdoors.”
Although he has continued to repeat that message, the number of people who have taken their masks off, even outdoors, has not increased that much. On trains, no matter how uncrowded they are, there are almost no passengers without masks.
Kishida is seeking to gradually relax efforts to fight the coronavirus by the time of the Group of Seven (G-7) summit to be held in the city of Hiroshima from May 19.
Nevertheless, the situation remains unpredictable. In the previous administrations of Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga, approval ratings fell as infection numbers rose. The Kishida Cabinet’s approval rating is currently stagnant at around 40 per cent due to scandals involving Cabinet ministers and other factors. The Kishida administration does not want a worsening of the infection situation to cause a further decline in support.
Some say that the pandemic disaster should be taken as an opportunity for Japanese to break free from strong peer pressure and make their own proactive decisions.
Shigeru Omi, a former director general of the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organisation who has been studying coronavirus countermeasures as an adviser to the government, said, “At the present time, having administrators and experts decide when and whether masks should be worn is no more appropriate than it would be to have them dictate the raising and lowering of chopsticks.”
As I mentioned before, peer pressure can also have a positive effect. As a result of the government’s careful explanation of the benefits of vaccination, the percentage of Japanese who have received at least one shot of novel coronavirus vaccine exceeded 80 per cent. One of the reasons for such a high vaccination rate may be that the government created an atmosphere in which “everyone is getting vaccinated.”
Whether or not to wear a mask is obviously a personal decision, but people expect the prime minister to provide a careful explanation of the infection situation to create an environment in which Japanese people can remove their masks without worry.
Kishida may need to make good use of peer pressure to convince the Japanese that everyone else is taking off their masks.

South Korea’s embattled chip industry: Korea Herald,"SEOUL - South Korean chipmakers are likely to face not only a slowdown in demand for semiconductors, but also critical restrictions from the US over production in China - collateral damage from the intensifying friction in US-China trade.
The US is reportedly planning to limit the level of advanced chips that Korean chip manufacturers can produce in China in the name of blocking the transfer of its advanced semiconductor technology to adversaries.
“We are now in a world where technology is the driver of military power, (with) advanced technologies, cutting-edge critical technologies, (and) semiconductors being at the centre of those technologies,” said Alan Estevez, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security, at a forum last week.
His comments reflect the US’ suspicion that China may be stealing its cutting-edge technology to strengthen its own chip-building capability, which could pose a threat.
This situation does not involve only the confrontation between the US and China. Of course, China is accused of having engaged in industrial espionage through Chinese tech firms. But the US, for its part, has been stepping up protectionist trade restrictions in recent years, citing security concerns.
As this stance is intended to appeal to its own citizens and companies, it seems unlikely that the US will reverse its course.
In October, Korean semiconductor producers were given a one-year licence to continue producing their products in China. The grace period was as part of US export restrictions on chips and other technologies to China.
What Estevez suggested is that the US will not extend the grace period beyond October this year and possibly impose more controls on chip production in China.
Unfortunately, such US policy on advanced technology, if implemented in October, is feared to seriously damage the South Korean chip industry as a whole. As with other Korean exporters, Samsung Electronics and SK hynix have been closely interlocked with both the US and China in terms of chip production and exports.
Korea exports some 40 per cent of its chips to China, an undisputedly crucial market for local chip producers. Samsung’s Chinese chip plant in Xian produces around 40 percent of the company’s NAND flash memory products, while SK hynix’s factory in Wuxi manufacturers about 48 per cent of its DRAM chips.
The two chip companies combined are estimated to have so far invested in over 50 trillion won (S$51.2 billion) in Chinese chip production facilities. Much of their heavy investment might go to waste if they are blocked by the US, preventing further use of advanced chip production technology.
Furthermore, troubles with Chinese factories could spark a severe backlash to Samsung and SK hynix. Under the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government is scheduled to receive subsidy applications from companies planning to construct chip plants within the US.
If Samsung and SK hynix want to receive subsidies for the plans to build chip facilities in the US, they have to sign a pact that will restrict chip production in China for the next 10 years. Depending on how the US tweaks the rules, the Korean chip producers may be stuck with outdated technologies for their Chinese plants.
It is regrettable that the US is set to go ahead with such restrictive measures that could undercut the companies of its allies. It also goes against what the US preaches about free markets in the past, as the current policy is largely designed to put its companies in a better position than foreign counterparts and expand its own chip industry with exclusive technologies.
But the Korean government cannot afford to complain about US export controls on semiconductor technology.
In 2022, Korean carmakers suffered a critical setback due to the similarly protectionist Inflation Reduction Act, which calls for up to US$7,500 (S$10,090) in tax credits to buyers of electric vehicles assembled in North America. Concerns mounted that Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp., both of which assemble EVs at domestic plants, could lose market share in the US.
The government should make sure that Korean chip manufacturers will not face similar disadvantages by holding active negotiations with the US government and seeking ways to minimise the negative impacts of the export control policy. THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK

Thai transgender actress Poyd Treechada weds businessman in traditional ceremony,"BANGKOK - Actress, model and beauty queen Poy Treechada Petcharat married a businessman from an elite Phuket family on Wednesday.
The ceremony followed the traditional Peranakan style, which originated with the wave of Chinese immigrants to the region six centuries ago.
Poy – who won the Miss Tiffany and Miss International Queen pageants in 2004 – married Oak Bhavagha Hongyok at Phuket’s Baan Ar-Jor. The 84-year-old Sino-colonial estate is a museum, a restaurant and the Hongyok family’s mansion.
Oak’s family traces its roots back to the beginning of Phuket’s tin industry. The family patriarch – Tan Jin Nguan – was a Chinese immigrant who launched tin mining in the province and was bestowed with the royal surname “Hong Yok” for developing the industry.
After winning the beauty pageants at the age of 18, Poy became a force in the entertainment industry in Thailand and the region. She has worked as a model, actress and performer in music videos.
In 2013, she made the leap to Hong Kong cinema, and worked with Hong Kong stars.
The bride and groom were attired in Peranakan wedding costumes that cost about 20 million baht (S$772,103) for a ceremony restricted to family and close friends.
Poy wore a traditional bridal gown embroidered with gold thread, antique gold jewellery and jewels. She also wore a “hua kuan”, or flower crown, handmade with pure gold by artisans from Ranong province. The crown took three months to finish.
The wedding costumes of both the bride and the groom took months to complete.
Poy and Oak have known each other for 20 years. He is the brother of her best friend. She began using his family name at her bachelorette party in Bangkok last month.
She is now a member of one of Phuket’s most famous families. They have embraced her.

"2 new hawker centres to open this year; 25 scheduled to undergo repairs, redecoration: Amy Khor","Buangkok Hawker Centre will have 38 cooked food stalls and 721 seats while Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre will have 39 cooked food stalls and 725 seats
SINGAPORE: Two new hawker centres, including one in Buangkok, will open this year, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor on Thursday (Mar 2).
Buangkok Hawker Centre and Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre are expected to be operational this year, Dr Khor announced in Parliament together with updates on efforts to safeguard the hawker trade in Singapore.
Buangkok Hawker Centre - located at 70 Compassvale Bow - will have 38 cooked food stalls and 721 seats while Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre - at 202C Woodleigh Link - will have 39 cooked food stalls and 725 seats, according to a joint press release from the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).
""When open, both hawker centres will be well-connected to neighbourhood amenities and transport nodes,"" said NEA and MSE.
""As with other new hawker centres, these two hawker centres have been designed to provide patrons and stallholders a comfortable dining and working environment.""
Features include high ceilings for good natural ventilation and spacious seating areas.
The refurbished Jurong West Hawker Centre is also slated to reopen in the third quarter of this year. It will have a revamped layout and more cooked food stalls when it opens.
A total of 25 hawker centres, including Holland Village Market and Food Centre, are scheduled for repairs and redecoration this year.
""Such periodic restoration of hawker centres, carried out every six to eight years, keeps them in a good physical condition and ensures a pleasant dining environment for patrons,"" said the agencies.
From next year, Geylang Serai Market and Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre will undergo the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme.
This will involve a reconfiguration of seats, ventilation enhancements such as new fittings and fans, and extensive retiling, among other enhancements.
Separately, NEA said it will work with operators of new hawker centres to pilot the use of snack kiosks to bring in a wider variety of snacks, such as muah chee and putu piring.

SINGAPORE: Two new hawker centres, including one in Buangkok, will open this year, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor on Thursday (Mar 2).
Buangkok Hawker Centre and Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre are expected to be operational this year, Dr Khor announced in Parliament together with updates on efforts to safeguard the hawker trade in Singapore.
Buangkok Hawker Centre - located at 70 Compassvale Bow - will have 38 cooked food stalls and 721 seats while Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre - at 202C Woodleigh Link - will have 39 cooked food stalls and 725 seats, according to a joint press release from the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).
""When open, both hawker centres will be well-connected to neighbourhood amenities and transport nodes,"" said NEA and MSE.
""As with other new hawker centres, these two hawker centres have been designed to provide patrons and stallholders a comfortable dining and working environment.""
Features include high ceilings for good natural ventilation and spacious seating areas.
The refurbished Jurong West Hawker Centre is also slated to reopen in the third quarter of this year. It will have a revamped layout and more cooked food stalls when it opens.
A total of 25 hawker centres, including Holland Village Market and Food Centre, are scheduled for repairs and redecoration this year.
""Such periodic restoration of hawker centres, carried out every six to eight years, keeps them in a good physical condition and ensures a pleasant dining environment for patrons,"" said the agencies.
From next year, Geylang Serai Market and Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre will undergo the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme.
This will involve a reconfiguration of seats, ventilation enhancements such as new fittings and fans, and extensive retiling, among other enhancements.
Separately, NEA said it will work with operators of new hawker centres to pilot the use of snack kiosks to bring in a wider variety of snacks, such as muah chee and putu piring.

""We have also received feedback that some local snacks are increasingly less commonly found,"" said Dr Khor. ""Those selling such snacks usually find it difficult to sustain an entire cooked food stall.

""We will monitor the viability of such kiosks before deciding if we should scale up this pilot.""
These kiosks, which could incur lower rental and operating costs, could help preserve snacks as a part of hawker culture, said the NEA."
Japan's parliament to vote on BOJ nominees next week,"TOKYO : Japan's lower house of parliament is set to vote on the government's nominees for new central bank governor and its two deputies at its plenary session on March 9, a senior ruling party lawmaker said on Thursday.
Last month the government nominated Kazuo Ueda, an academic and a former Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy board member, as new central bank governor. It also named former financial watchdog head Ryozo Himino, and BOJ executive Shinichi Uchida, as the two deputy governors.
Unlike incumbent Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who arrived with a clear mandate to beat deflation with massive stimulus, Ueda faces the delicate task of phasing out his predecessor's radical and complicated policy framework without derailing a fragile economic recovery.
The nominations need approval of both of parliament's houses to take effect, which is almost a done deal given the ruling coalition's solid majority in the both chambers. Incumbent chief Haruhiko Kuroda's term ends on April 8 and the two deputies' terms end on March 19.
The lower house vote will be followed by one in the upper house on March 10, parliament sources told Reuters on Thursday.
""This will be approved. We will formally decide on the voting schedule at executives' meeting on March 7"" at the lower chamber's steering committee, its chief Shunichi Yamaguchi told reporters.

'Horror movie set' or 'outstanding design'? Tampines BTO residents have mixed views on vivid colour schemes in common areas,"· Tampines GreenVines, a new BTO public housing project, went viral on social media for its red colour scheme in the common areas of some blocks of flats
· Newly arrived homeowners have described the colour scheme as “creepy”, “spooky”, and “very unpleasant” although one resident said it was an ""outstanding"" design
· In response to this, HDB has arranged to have the red lift lobbies partially repainted in white
· Other blocks at the project have a yellow colour scheme and some still under construction are purplish-blue
A couple had just collected the keys to their unit at the new Tampines GreenVines Build-to-Order (BTO) project and were visiting it for the first time this week when they got a shock at what they saw. The lift lobby had been tiled and painted entirely in a bright yellow that they said was reminiscent of a “Hong Kong horror movie set”.
Mr and Mrs Yap, both 40, described the public housing block’s colour scheme as ""weird"".
The couple, who work as managers in the education and training industry, and declined to give their full names, said that they would prefer that the walls and ceiling at the block be of a neutral colour.
They have yet to speak directly with the town council, but said that they might do so if no action is taken. Town councils are responsible for the upkeep of public housing estates and provide essential public services to residents, including the cleaning and maintenance of common areas in the estates such as void decks and lifts.
Pictures and videos of the couple's neighbouring block 640B – painted a vivid red – have gone viral on social media with residents interviewed by TODAY describing its aesthetic as “creepy”, “spooky” and “very unpleasant”.
Beyond the look of the red blocks, residents also flagged safety concerns over the dim ambient lighting – which they believe would pose a threat to older residents traversing the corridors when the public space gets dark at night.

"WTA roundup: Katie Volynets escapes 5-0, third-set hole","March 2 - Down 5-0 and a match point in the third set, the United States' Katie Volynets rallied to upset third-seeded Anastasia Potapova of Russia 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 on Wednesday in the second round of the ATX Open in Austin, Texas.
Volynets heated up while winning the last seven games, as she lost just one point total in the final three games. The result moves the 21-year-old into a WTA Tour quarterfinal for the first time.
Up next for Volynets is a matchup against hometown favorite Peyton Stearns, who won the 2022 NCAA women's singles championship for the University of Texas. Stearns downed Sweden's Mirjam Bjorklund 6-3, 7-5 in second-round action.

Cricket: Women's sport a winner as money pours into India league,"MUMBAI – India’s inaugural Women’s Premier League cricket has generated hundreds of millions of dollars even before a ball is bowled on Saturday, with experts calling it a game-changing moment for women’s sport.
The Twenty20 tournament’s five debut franchises together sold for nearly US$200 million (S$269 million) – more than the eight founding teams of the men’s Indian Premier League in 2008.
Together with media rights for the first five seasons, the WPL has already earned India’s cricket board a shade under US$700 million, making it the second most valuable domestic women’s sport competition globally after US professional basketball.
“That’s an unprecedented amount of investment into the women’s game,” James Savage of the Deloitte Sports Business Group told AFP.
“That level of investment has come around because of the huge growth potential.”
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is betting big on the WPL and women’s sport is attracting higher levels of viewership, media coverage, TV rights and sponsorships globally.
More than 86,000 people watched the 2020 Women’s T20 World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between hosts Australia and India, the highest ever for a women’s cricket match.
And television audiences – a crucial metric for boosting media rights revenue for organisers – have also been hitting records across women’s sport.
“It’s additional confirmation that... women’s sports is the next economy for sport,” said Thayer Lavielle of The Collective, the women’s division of US sports marketing agency Wasserman.
“I believe that marketers need to really start to pay attention to what satisfies us,” she told AFP.
Underlining global interest in the WPL, British broadcaster Sky Sports said on Wednesday that it will show matches live.
The final of the tournament is on March 26. All games are in Mumbai.
The BCCI last year sold the media rights for five IPL seasons for a record US$6.2 billion and hopes the women’s equivalent will eventually prove similarly lucrative.
“The initial response to the WPL has definitely showcased the potential the league has to become the biggest women’s domestic sporting tournament,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah told AFP.
“The WPL will set a template for other sports to follow suit.”
Top players lined up for the WPL auction, with India’s Smriti Mandhana the top pick, earning US$410,000 for her services.
Australia’s Ash Gardner and England’s Nat Sciver-Brunt tied for the highest overseas players’ contract at US$387,000.
Some players will earn more for the three-week tournament than they normally would in an entire year.
That could extend both the player pool and competitors’ careers: Indian parents are often reluctant to allow girls to pursue sporting careers, but the emergence of a financial path could change the incentives.
Former New Zealand men’s coach Mike Hesson, now director of cricket at Royal Challengers Bangalore, told AFP it would build participation.
“Young viewers can watch them play, then that’s going to encourage them to pick up the sport,” he said.
And retired Indian captain Mithali Raj, now part of the Gujarat Giants coaching staff, said cricketers who missed selection for the national team could “stick longer with the game”. AFP
- Show me the money -
A 2021 Deloitte study found the gender gap between men’s and women’s sports revenue was “beginning to close”, while the three main revenue streams for elite women’s sport – TV rights, event-day attendance and sponsorships – were all growing.
“But the entire sports industry should invest in creating more opportunities for women’s sports if it is to prove its commercial worth,” the report said.
Investors have already ploughed huge sums into the WPL, including Indian tycoon and Gujarat Giants owner Gautam Adani, but it remains to be seen what audiences the tournament can attract and whether it will turn a profit.
“This investment can pay rich dividends only in the long term, provided women’s cricket attracts mass following in India,” said Elara Capital media analyst Karan Taurani in a note.
Deloitte’s Savage says the true benchmark of success will be whether women cricketers such as Shafali Verma can have the same profile as Indian cricket hero Virat Kohli.
“I think a dream scenario would be you don’t need to prefix a sport with ‘men’s’ or ‘women’s’,” said Savage.
“You just say, it’s cricket.”

"China’s top tech banker detained by antigraft agency, WSJ says","BEIJING - Bao Fan, chairman of China Renaissance Holdings, has been detained since February by the country’s antigraft investigators, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
The star banker’s detention by China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is related to an earlier investigation into Cong Lin, China Renaissance’s former president, according to the report.
Bao is being held under a special form of detention known as “liuzhi”, or “retention in custody,” where a person may be detained for as long as six months without any access to a lawyer, the report said, adding it remains unclear if Bao will be formally arrested and charged.
The development may further unnerve the nation’s business elite and add to growing signs that President Xi Jinping is not yet letting up on his yearlong crackdown on the private sector as well as the US$60 trillion (S$80.5 trillion) finance industry.
Before the detention, authorities had spoken to Bao several times over a period of months regarding the probe of Cong, according to the report. Bao was queried about a suspected quid pro quo involving a loan that Cong helped arrange for China Renaissance before joining the firm, the WSJ said.
Bloomberg News reported last month that Cong has been involved in a probe by authorities since September while China Renaissance said last week that Bao was cooperating in an unspecified investigation by Chinese authorities.
Mr Xi launched a broad anti-corruption probe in late 2021 targeting the nation’s financial sector, which has brought down dozens of officials. Tian Huiyu, the former president of China Merchants Bank, was among the latest charged with violations including taking bribes.
The probe has also implicated the investment banking community, ensnaring bankers from brokerages including Everbright Securities and Guotai Junan Securities.

The star banker’s detention by China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is related to an earlier investigation into Cong Lin, China Renaissance’s former president, according to the report.
Bao is being held under a special form of detention known as “liuzhi”, or “retention in custody,” where a person may be detained for as long as six months without any access to a lawyer, the report said, adding it remains unclear if Bao will be formally arrested and charged.
The development may further unnerve the nation’s business elite and add to growing signs that President Xi Jinping is not yet letting up on his yearlong crackdown on the private sector as well as the US$60 trillion (S$80.5 trillion) finance industry.
Before the detention, authorities had spoken to Bao several times over a period of months regarding the probe of Cong, according to the report. Bao was queried about a suspected quid pro quo involving a loan that Cong helped arrange for China Renaissance before joining the firm, the WSJ said.
Bloomberg News reported last month that Cong has been involved in a probe by authorities since September while China Renaissance said last week that Bao was cooperating in an unspecified investigation by Chinese authorities.
Mr Xi launched a broad anti-corruption probe in late 2021 targeting the nation’s financial sector, which has brought down dozens of officials. Tian Huiyu, the former president of China Merchants Bank, was among the latest charged with violations including taking bribes.
The probe has also implicated the investment banking community, ensnaring bankers from brokerages including Everbright Securities and Guotai Junan Securities.

"Power of trees and soil to absorb carbon may be waning, experts warn","BARCELONA – All the carbon dioxide (CO2) that’s accumulating in the atmosphere and heating the planet has given carbon-munching things on the ground plenty to eat. Land ecosystems have taken more CO2 out of the atmosphere in the last few decades than they did before – a “bonus” that essentially cleans up some pollution for us.
Scientists hope it lasts, but they’re increasingly worried it won’t: Stressed forests and other ecosystems may be sending us advance warnings that they are transforming under pressure.
About 30 per cent of carbon emissions end up in plants, trees and soil, and another 25 per cent in the ocean. The past few years have brought concerns that the land carbon sink – as scientists refer to it – is becoming destabilised. The carbon absorption of the ocean and the Amazon may already be slowing down.
Satellite imagery and ground measurements reveal that the CO2 bonus is less stable, particularly in places with drying soils and limited nitrogen, which plants need to grow. Spots of concern include eastern Africa, the Mediterranean region, the North and Central American western coasts, India and southeast Asia, according to a study published last week in Nature.
The research team measured two elements of these systems: the year-to-year changes in carbon uptake, and how likely it is for a system to return to its previous condition. When there are a lot of shocks – and climate change is already delivering them – and when the area doesn’t snap back to its original state, the odds increase that systemic change is underway. As as result, the land draws down less of our atmospheric carbon.
“Every oscillation in the system gets amplified through time, because it ‘remembers’ better what happened before,” said Marcos Fernández-Martínez, a researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the lead author of the Nature study. “So these ripples get bigger and bigger and bigger, and then they lead to an eventual change in the state of that system.”
The researchers for the first time applied to land carbon sinks a methodology used previously to study so-called tipping points in major Earth systems that keep the planet running in the manner we’re accustomed to.
Two other studies released last month provided updates on the big picture.
One of those, a commentary in the journal One Earth, offered what the researchers called “the most extensive list available of climate feedback loops,” or large-scale changes that either increase or decrease global heating. The authors found 41, ranging from sea-ice loss to thawing permafrost, wildfires, forest decay and insect outbreaks. 27 of them make climate change worse, seven help us out and another seven are unclear in effect.
The increased CO2 going into plants and forests is identified as an ally in the climate fight, so if their ability to absorb that CO2 is weakening, it means people have to make up the difference by sending up less carbon.
Timothy Lenton, a leading tipping-points researcher at the UK’s University of Exeter, said the Nature study, which he did not work on, makes sense in that it backs up what scientists have been predicting.
“It’s not good news, but scientifically, it’s encouraging to see that there’s what we would expect as the consistent signal of instability,” he said.
Likewise, a wide-ranging scientific review published last month in Reviews of Geophysics examined what the authors called “tipping elements.” Led by Seaver Wang, co-director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, the study in part looked at the effect of extra CO2 specifically on Amazon forests. Researchers found that while the CO2 drawdown can compensate for some losses of land or forest carbon, it’s not as well understood as they’d like and that makes it difficult to draw conclusions about global rainforests.
The world has heated up 1.2 deg C since industrialisation and is expected to pass the 1.5 deg C guideline stipulated by the Paris agreement in the next two decades. To pull down enough CO2 to lower the temperature back below 1.5 deg C would require a very healthy, very hungry biosphere, said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office Hadley Centre and a University of Exeter professor, who was not a part of the Nature study.

Water recycling requirements to be mandated for water-intensive industries: Grace Fu,"SINGAPORE - To help reduce water consumption among water-intensive industries, PUB will be mandating recycling requirements for new projects in these sectors from Jan 1, 2024, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Thursday.
These include projects in the wafer fabrication, electronics and biomedical industries, which account for about 17 per cent of non-domestic water demand, she noted.
The national water agency said with Singapore consuming about 440 million gallons of water per day and total water demand expected to almost double by 2065, recycling water can help companies by reducing their water bills and contributing to their long-term competitiveness.
PUB added that a major source of water demand growth is expected to come from the non-domestic sector, where demand is projected to increase from 55 per cent of total consumption currently to more than 60 per cent.
“There is also high potential for water recycling in these industries, as their used water streams can be effectively recycled when segregated at source. In addition, some waste water streams from the electronics and biomedical plants are fairly clean, making it easier to recycle with minimal treatment required,” it said.
Therefore, water fabrication plants involved in front-end semiconductor manufacturing, which consume at least 60,000 m3 of water annually, would have to recycle at least 50 per cent of their water consumption.
Likewise, electronic and biomedical plants which consume the same volume of water annually would be required to recycle their specified waste streams.
With these measures in place, PUB said that the water savings could reach 9 million gallons of water per day - equivalent to 15 Olympic-sized swimming pools daily – from 2035 onwards.
The agency has consulted companies from the affected industries, and said that the companies have found the new recycling requirements to be achievable for new projects.
The median water recycling rate among existing wafer fabrication plants currently stands at 43 per cent, PUB noted.
Companies looking to implement these water recycling projects can apply for financial support from PUB’s Water Efficiency Fund and the Industrial Water Solutions Demonstration Fund within the next two years, until end-2025.
PUB is also reviewing its funding framework and looking into providing more incentives for companies to achieve higher recycling rate beyond the mandated 50 per cent level.

"Ex-BOJ gov Shirakawa urges re-examination of monetary framework, inflation targets","TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Former Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Masaaki Shirakawa called on policymakers to reconsider central banks' monetary framework based on inflation targets, given their limits that became apparent from the recent spike in prices seen in many countries.
Before the recent spike in inflation, many central banks in advanced economies were ""overwhelmingly"" concerned about low inflation, and failed to restrain rapid price gains by judging them as transitory, Shirakawa said in a column published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday.
By allowing inflation to overshoot their targets, central banks ""forgot the difficulty of taking away the monetary punch bowl"" and failed to tighten policy soon enough, he said.
""Inflation targeting itself was an innovation that came about in response to the severe stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. There is no reason to believe it is set in stone,"" Shirakawa said.
""Now that we know its limitations, the time is ripe to reconsider the intellectual foundation on which we have relied for the past 30 years and renew our framework for monetary policy,"" he added.
Shirakawa, who was BOJ governor before incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda, also criticised the central bank's current forward guidance committing to keep interest rates ultra-low.
""When the economy is hit by a surprise shock to demand or supply, forward guidance of continuing low interest rates can suddenly become too expansionary and inflationary. This may partly explain what we are seeing now,"" he said.
During his term as BOJ head until 2013, Shirakawa was frequently criticised for doing too little too late to pull Japan out of decades of deflation and economic stagnation.
His successor and current governor, Kuroda, deployed a ""bazooka"" stimulus programme in 2013 that boosted growth for several years, but failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ's 2% target and left the bank with a dearth of ammunition.
With rising raw material costs keeping inflation well above the BOJ's 2% target, markets are rife with speculation the central bank will phase out its massive stimulus when incoming governor Kazuo Ueda succeeds Kuroda in April.
In a parliament confirmation hearing on Monday, Ueda said he had ideas on how the central bank could exit its massive stimulus, but stressed a shift to tighter policy would only come when Japan's trend inflation heightens significantly.

"Oil holds gains on China rebound, even as U.S. crude stocks rise","· Companies
SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up in early Asian trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous two sessions on signs of a strong economic rebound in China, the world's top oil importer, which offset worries about a rise in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $84.43 a barrel at 0231 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 7 cents, or 0.1%, at $77.76 a barrel.
Both contracts rose about 1% in the previous session after data showed manufacturing activity in China in February grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade, adding to evidence of an economic rebound after the removal of strict COVID-19 curbs.
However a tenth consecutive week of crude stock builds in the United States capped the market's gains.
U.S. crude inventories (USOILC=ECI) rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week ending Feb. 24 to 480.2 million barrels, their highest level since May 2021, the Energy Information Administration reported.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 500,000-barrel rise.
Record exports of U.S. crude oil, however, kept the build smaller than in recent weeks, with shipments rising to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to the EIA.
""U.S. crude inventories slowed their increases but sit at above the five-year range, with the slowdown of builds due to surging gross exports to new records,"" Citi analysts said in a client note.
Meanwhile, crude oil processed by Indian refiners reached record levels in January, provisional government data on Wednesday showed, as the country boosted imports of Russian barrels that Western countries shunned.
Refinery throughput in the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer reached 5.39 million barrels per day for January, the highest since Reuters records going back to 2009.

SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up in early Asian trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous two sessions on signs of a strong economic rebound in China, the world's top oil importer, which offset worries about a rise in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $84.43 a barrel at 0231 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 7 cents, or 0.1%, at $77.76 a barrel.
Both contracts rose about 1% in the previous session after data showed manufacturing activity in China in February grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade, adding to evidence of an economic rebound after the removal of strict COVID-19 curbs.
However a tenth consecutive week of crude stock builds in the United States capped the market's gains.
U.S. crude inventories (USOILC=ECI) rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week ending Feb. 24 to 480.2 million barrels, their highest level since May 2021, the Energy Information Administration reported.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 500,000-barrel rise.
Record exports of U.S. crude oil, however, kept the build smaller than in recent weeks, with shipments rising to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to the EIA.
""U.S. crude inventories slowed their increases but sit at above the five-year range, with the slowdown of builds due to surging gross exports to new records,"" Citi analysts said in a client note.
Meanwhile, crude oil processed by Indian refiners reached record levels in January, provisional government data on Wednesday showed, as the country boosted imports of Russian barrels that Western countries shunned.
Refinery throughput in the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer reached 5.39 million barrels per day for January, the highest since Reuters records going back to 2009.

SINGAPORE: The Government will publish an annual report to detail its progress, efforts and plans in environmental sustainability starting in Financial Year 2023, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu told Parliament on Thursday (Mar 2).
The annual report comes under the GreenGov.SG initiative, which details how the public sector will lead the way in pursuing sustainable development.
Under GreenGov.SG, the Government has committed to achieve several sustainability targets by 2030, including for energy, water and waste, and to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of the national target.
""We will start with reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions, electricity, and water consumption, with reference to international standards and frameworks,"" said Ms Fu.

Brumbies brace for Blues juggernaut in Super Rugby Pacific,"MELBOURNE : The relative strength of Australian and New Zealand rugby will be on display this weekend when Canberra's ACT Brumbies meet the Auckland Blues in a repeat of last year's Super Rugby Pacific semi-final.
The Brumbies dominated their Australian rivals last year but fell short in a 20-19 thriller at Eden Park as the Blues booked their place in the final against the eventual champion Canterbury Crusaders.
The Blues have won their last 14 regular season matches, including last week's 60-20 hiding of the Otago Highlanders in their season-opener in Dunedin.
The Brumbies, however, have proved tough foes for the Blues and head into Sunday's afternoon clash at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium confident after a solid 31-25 win over the improving New South Wales Waratahs.
""We know the Brumbies will bring a physical, confronting game and we have been preparing all week to meet that challenge,"" Blues captain Dalton Papalii said.
All matches will be played at the Rectangular Stadium in three consecutive days of double-headers as part of the competition's ""Super Round"".
The Crusaders, who face the Otago Highlanders on Friday, might welcome the chance to play in a city where rugby is barely on the radar given the media storm over the All Blacks' coaching situation back home.
Within six weeks, Crusaders' coach Scott Robertson is expected to be confirmed as Ian Foster's successor as All Blacks coach after the World Cup in France, regardless of the application process announced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) on Wednesday.
The Crusaders were upset 31-10 by the Waikato Chiefs in a major shock at home last weekend, and Robertson will not want another defeat on his ledger before interviews with NZR.
He will have veteran All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock back in the side fore the Highlanders clash and has restored the formidable midfield partnership of David Havili and Jack Goodhue after using Havili at fullback last week.
The Wellington Hurricanes will look to back up their impressive 47-13 win away to the Queensland Reds when they meet the home team, Melbourne Rebels, on Friday.
Hurricanes winger Julian Savea scored his 58th try against the Reds and can match Israel Folau's all-time Super Rugby record with a double against the Rebels.
The Waratahs experimented with dual opensides in their back row against the Brumbies but ditched that after one match, dropping Charlie Gamble to the bench for their match against Fijian Drua on Saturday.
The Western Force, meanwhile, have promoted comeback king Jeremy Thrush to their starting lineup for Sunday's match against the Reds after the 37-year-old lock scored the winning try off the bench against the Rebels last week.
Thrush retired in the off-season but was coaxed back to the game after an injury to Izack Rodda.

Brumbies brace for Blues juggernaut in Super Rugby Pacific,"MELBOURNE, March 2 (Reuters) - The relative strength of Australian and New Zealand rugby will be on display this weekend when Canberra's ACT Brumbies meet the Auckland Blues in a repeat of last year's Super Rugby Pacific semi-final.
The Brumbies dominated their Australian rivals last year but fell short in a 20-19 thriller at Eden Park as the Blues booked their place in the final against the eventual champion Canterbury Crusaders.
The Blues have won their last 14 regular season matches, including last week's 60-20 hiding of the Otago Highlanders in their season-opener in Dunedin.
The Brumbies, however, have proved tough foes for the Blues and head into Sunday's afternoon clash at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium confident after a solid 31-25 win over the improving New South Wales Waratahs.
""We know the Brumbies will bring a physical, confronting game and we have been preparing all week to meet that challenge,"" Blues captain Dalton Papalii said.
All matches will be played at the Rectangular Stadium in three consecutive days of double-headers as part of the competition's ""Super Round"".
The Crusaders, who face the Otago Highlanders on Friday, might welcome the chance to play in a city where rugby is barely on the radar given the media storm over the All Blacks' coaching situation back home.
Within six weeks, Crusaders' coach Scott Robertson is expected to be confirmed as Ian Foster's successor as All Blacks coach after the World Cup in France, regardless of the application process announced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) on Wednesday.
The Crusaders were upset 31-10 by the Waikato Chiefs in a major shock at home last weekend, and Robertson will not want another defeat on his ledger before interviews with NZR.
He will have veteran All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock back in the side fore the Highlanders clash and has restored the formidable midfield partnership of David Havili and Jack Goodhue after using Havili at fullback last week.
The Wellington Hurricanes will look to back up their impressive 47-13 win away to the Queensland Reds when they meet the home team, Melbourne Rebels, on Friday.
Hurricanes winger Julian Savea scored his 58th try against the Reds and can match Israel Folau's all-time Super Rugby record with a double against the Rebels.
The Waratahs experimented with dual opensides in their back row against the Brumbies but ditched that after one match, dropping Charlie Gamble to the bench for their match against Fijian Drua on Saturday.
The Western Force, meanwhile, have promoted comeback king Jeremy Thrush to their starting lineup for Sunday's match against the Reds after the 37-year-old lock scored the winning try off the bench against the Rebels last week.
Thrush retired in the off-season but was coaxed back to the game after an injury to Izack Rodda.
The Chiefs will look to continue their perfect start when they meet Moana Pasifika in the early match on Saturday.

Body of baby found close to where runaway British heiress and sex offender partner were arrested,"A 55-day search for a missing baby reached its tragic conclusion when UK authorities found the body in a woodland area near Brighton, close to where runaway heiress Constance Marten and her sex offender partner Mark Gordon were arrested on Monday.
The investigation over the missing baby began when the couple’s car was found on fire near Manchester on Jan 5, with local authorities discovering an expulsed placenta in the back seat of the vehicle.
Marten is the daughter of British aristocrat Napier Marten and a former page to the late Queen Elizabeth II, who was godmother to her grandmother Mary Anna Marten.
The heiress was last seen on Jan 7, said London’s Metropolitan Police Service.
The 35-year-old was spotted with her 48-year-old partner – a convicted sex offender who had spent 20 years behind bars in a Florida prison for rape and battery – leaving a taxi at Whitechapel Road in London’s East End with their heads and faces covered.
Gordon was wearing white plastic bags over his shoes, which were later removed, according to closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage.
Detectives established that he bought camping equipment, following which the pair evaded police for several weeks, before being arrested on Monday night after being spotted by a member of the public.
CNN reported on Wednesday that a host of police resources were activated to search for the missing baby after the couple were arrested, including police helicopters, sniffer dogs, thermal imaging cameras and drones.
Meanwhile, more than 200 officers were on the ground participating in the search.
The couple were initially arrested on suspicion of child neglect, but once the body had been found, they were “further arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter,” said London’s Metropolitan Police.
Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford of the Metropolitan Police’s East Area Command was reported as saying that investigations were expected to continue for some time, after a crime scene was established around the baby’s remains.
“This is an outcome that myself and the many officers who have been part of the search had hoped would not happen,” he said.",2023-03-02 03:32:28.690000+00:00,,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/body-of-baby-found-close-to-where-runaway-british-heiress-and-sex-offender-partner-were-arrested,"Body of baby found close to where runaway British heiress and sex offender partner were arrestedA 55-day search for a missing baby reached its tragic conclusion when UK authorities found the body in a woodland area near Brighton, close to where runaway heiress Constance Marten and her sex offender partner Mark Gordon were arrested on Monday.

"Six Malaysian states flooded, Johor worst hit","Non-stop rains have caused flooding in six Malaysian states, with the southern state of Johor the worst hit.
Over 26,000 people have been moved to 220 temporary relief centres nationwide as the weather agency predicted continuous heavy rains until Thursday.
All 10 districts in Johor have been hit by flood, with more than 25,000 victims from 7,000 families seeking shelter at 187 temporary flood relief centres as at 8am on Thursday.
Johor crown prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim visited the flood-hit victims at a relief centre in Kluang on Wednesday night.
Johor state secretary Azmi Rohani said this was one of the worst floods to have inundated the state in the past few years, attributing it to continuous heavy rain and the high tide phenomenon.
The district of Segamat is the worst hit, followed by Kluang, Batu Pahat and Kota Tinggi districts.
Water levels of 18 rivers in Johor breached the dangerous mark following uninterrupted rains since Monday night, said Tan Sri Azmi.
Pahang is the second-worst affected state, with the authorities reporting on Thursday morning that at least 1,400 residents from five districts were placed at 27 relief centres.
Deputy prime minister Zahid Hamidi visited the flood-hit district of Rompin, Pahang on Wednesday night, where he instructed the authorities to build a temporary bridge after flood waters washed away a portion of the road to a Felda settlement.
In Melaka, about 70 were seeking refuge in three centres while in Negeri Sembilan, 760 victims were housed in 10 relief centres.

"Petronas clean energy arm sees India, Australia as key in rapid growth plans","KUALA LUMPUR - Gentari, the clean energy arm of Malaysia’s state oil firm Petronas, sees India and Australia as its key markets for growth and expects to tap more financing to meet its ambitious targets, its chief executive told Reuters.
Petronas launched Gentari as a separate entity in June, aiming to build renewable energy capacity of 30-40 gigawatts and produce up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of hydrogen by 2030 in Asia Pacific.
It also plans to establish 25,000 public charging points for electric vehicles.
In an interview on Wednesday, Gentari’s chief executive Sushil Purohit said India and Australia will be primary markets for growth in the near term in all fields of operation.
Both countries have provided the right policies to facilitate projects, while Malaysia also has a lot of potential, he said, adding growth could come from acquisitions and organically.
“In terms of expansion, we will seek to collaborate with companies in different markets. If there is a good strategic fit for us, we would look at that as an opportunity for us to buy into the company or acquire the company in totality,” Mr Purohit said.
Petronas, like other oil majors, is ramping up investments in clean energy as part of its net zero carbon emissions goals.
The state-owned company has said it would allocate 20 per cent of its overall capital expenditure for decarbonisation projects and cleaner energy solutions from 2023 to 2026.
Petronas planned capital expenditure of 60 billion ringgit (S$18 billion) last year.
Gentari’s home base of Malaysia still require polices and incentives that encourage private investments in the sectors, Mr Purohit said, adding that the firm intends to invest strongly in the Southeast Asian nation.
Last month, Gentari purchased Australian renewables firm Wirsol Energy, which has solar and battery energy storage systems. Gentari declined to disclose the price of the purchase, but one source put the enterprise value of the deal at A$1 billion (S$907 million).
In 2019, before Gentari’s formation, Petronas acquired Singapore-based solar energy company Amplus Energy Solutions which has projects in India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
Purohit said Gentari will seek out new investors for particular projects or countries to support its rapid growth plans.
“The capital requirement would be quite large. And that’s the reason we need to go out and get also funds from outside,” he said, without specifying an amount or time frame.

TOKYO : Former Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Masaaki Shirakawa called on policymakers to reconsider central banks' monetary framework based on inflation targets, given their limits that became apparent from the recent spike in prices seen in many countries.
Before the recent spike in inflation, many central banks in advanced economies were ""overwhelmingly"" concerned about low inflation, and failed to restrain rapid price gains by judging them as transitory, Shirakawa said in a column published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday.
By allowing inflation to overshoot their targets, central banks ""forgot the difficulty of taking away the monetary punch bowl"" and failed to tighten policy soon enough, he said.
""Inflation targeting itself was an innovation that came about in response to the severe stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. There is no reason to believe it is set in stone,"" Shirakawa said.
""Now that we know its limitations, the time is ripe to reconsider the intellectual foundation on which we have relied for the past 30 years and renew our framework for monetary policy,"" he added.
Shirakawa, who was BOJ governor before incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda, also criticised the central bank's current forward guidance committing to keep interest rates ultra-low.
""When the economy is hit by a surprise shock to demand or supply, forward guidance of continuing low interest rates can suddenly become too expansionary and inflationary. This may partly explain what we are seeing now,"" he said.
During his term as BOJ head until 2013, Shirakawa was frequently criticised for doing too little too late to pull Japan out of decades of deflation and economic stagnation.
His successor and current governor, Kuroda, deployed a ""bazooka"" stimulus programme in 2013 that boosted growth for several years, but failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ's 2 per cent target and left the bank with a dearth of ammunition.
With rising raw material costs keeping inflation well above the BOJ's 2 per cent target, markets are rife with speculation the central bank will phase out its massive stimulus when incoming governor Kazuo Ueda succeeds Kuroda in April.
In a parliament confirmation hearing on Monday, Ueda said he had ideas on how the central bank could exit its massive stimulus, but stressed a shift to tighter policy would only come when Japan's trend inflation heightens significantly.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Wednesday called on Party schools to stay true to their founding mission of fostering talent for and contributing wisdom to the Party.

Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while addressing a meeting marking the 90th anniversary of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee and the opening ceremony of its 2023 spring semester.
Party schools at all levels should stay committed to their founding mission and make new contributions to building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts, Xi said.

Party schools need to step up the education and training in Marxist theory, with a focus on using the latest achievements in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times to achieve unity in thought, will and action, as well as enhancing cohesion and forging the Party's soul with the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Xi said.
Noting that Party schools are places where leading officials strengthen their Party consciousness, Xi called on Party schools at all levels to guide and help leading officials in adopting the right attitude towards power, performance and career to preserve the political character of Communists.
Xi stressed that leading officials must improve their capabilities in all respects, strive to be highly proficient in their work, and make constant efforts to enhance their professionalism to be more competent in their work as leading officials.
Acknowledging the crucial role of Party schools in contributing wisdom to the CPC, Xi emphasized the need for them to produce more quality output in various domains including the study and interpretation of the Party's new theories, boosting the Party's theoretical innovation and offering suggestions and proposals to the Party and the government.
Party schools are the vital frontier of the Party's ideological work, which must be held in hands of those loyal to the Party and Marxism, Xi said.
Stressing rigorous governance over Party schools and their teaching quality, Xi underscored the key task of building a strong team and demanded strenuous efforts in implementing the strategy of invigorating the schools by developing a quality workforce.
Upholding the Party's overall leadership over the work of Party schools is the CPC's most fundamental experience in running Party schools, Xi said, urging Party committees and governments at all levels and departments involved to take actions to support the development of Party schools.
Chen Xi presided over the meeting. He said Xi's speech fully and deeply expounded the founding mission of Party schools, and serves as a guideline document for the development of Party schools in the new era.
Chen urged Party schools at all levels to thoroughly study and implement the guiding principles of Xi's speech, and to make new advances in their work on the new journey.

Explained | Combining social welfare and capital markets through SSE,"How does Social Stock Exchange function? How will NPOs and FPOs raise funds through this exchange?
The story so far: On February 22, the National Stock Exchange of India received the final approval from the markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to set up a Social Stock Exchange (SSE). Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the Union Budget back in 2019, had proposed to initiate steps for creating a stock exchange under the market regulator’s ambit. She had argued that it was time “to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives to inclusive growth and financial inclusion.” The proposal was cleared in September 2021.
What is a Social Stock Exchange?
The SSE would function as a separate segment within the existing stock exchange and help social enterprises raise funds from the public through its mechanism. It would serve as a medium for enterprises to seek finance for their social initiatives , acquire visibility and provide increased transparency about fund mobilisation and utilisation. Retail investors can only invest in securities offered by for-profit social enterprises (SEs) under the Main Board. In all other cases, only institutional investors and non-institutional investors can invest in securities issued by SEs.
What about eligibility?
Any non-profit organisation (NPO) or for-profit social enterprise (FPSEs) that establishes the primacy of social intent would be recognised as a social enterprise (SE), which will make it eligible to be registered or listed on the SSE.
The seventeen plausible criteria as listed under Regulations 292E of SEBI’s ICDR (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 entail that enterprises must be serving to eradicate either hunger, poverty, malnutrition and inequality; promoting education, employability, equality, empowerment of women and LGBTQIA+ communities; working towards environmental sustainability; protection of national heritage and art or bridging the digital divide, among other things. At least 67% of their activities must be directed towards attaining the stated objective. This is to be established by enumerating that, in the immediately preceding three-year period, either 67% of its average revenue came from the eligible activities, expenditure (in the same proportion) was incurred towards attaining the objective or the target population constitute 67% of the overall beneficiary base. Corporate foundations, political or religious organisations or activities, professional or trade associations, infrastructure and housing companies (except affordable housing) would not be identified as an SE.
Additionally, NPOs would be deemed ineligible should it be dependent on corporates for more than 50% of its funding.
How do NPOs raise money?
NPOs can raise money either through issuance of Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) Instruments from private placement or public issue, or donations from mutual funds. SEBI had earlier recognised that NPOs by their very nature have primacy of social impact and are non-revenue generating. Thus, there was a need to provide NPOs a direct access to securities market for raising funds. ZCZP bonds differ from conventional bonds in the sense that it entails zero coupon and no principal payment at maturity. The latter provisions a fixed interest (or repayment) on the funds raised through varied contractual agreement, whereas ZCZP would not provision any such return instead promising a social return.
It is mandatory that the NPO is registered with the SSE for facilitating the issuance. The instrument must have a specific tenure and can only be issued for a specific project or activity that is to be completed within a specified duration as mentioned in the fund-raising document (to be submitted to the SSE). It must also demonstrate the requisite expertise through their performance in similar projects in the past, thus, acquiring investor confidence and tackle concerns about potential default.
The minimum issue size is presently prescribed as Rs 1 crore and minimum application size for subscription at Rs 2 lakhs for ZCZP issuance.
The NPO may choose to register on the SSE and not raise funds through it but via other means. However, they would have to make necessary disclosures about the same.
What about on completion of projects?
Another structured finance product available for NPOs is the Development Impact Bonds. Upon the completion of a project and having delivered on pre-agreed social metrices at pre-agreed costs/rates, a grant is made to the NPO. The donor who makes the grant upon achieving the social metrics would be referred to as ‘Outcome Funders’.
Since the payment above is on post facto basis, the NPOs would have to also raise money to finance their operations. This is done by a ‘Risk Funder’ who alongside enabling the financing of operations on a pre-payment basis, also bears the associated risk with non-delivery of social metrics. S/he typically earns a small return if the metrics are delivered.
How do FPOs raise money?
For-Profit Enterprises (FPEs) need not register with social stock exchanges before it raises funds through SSE. However, it must comply with all provisions of the ICDR Regulations when raising through the SSE. It can raise money through issue of equity shares (on main board, SME platform or innovators growth platform of the stock exchange) or issuing equity shares to an Alternative Investment Fund including Social Impact Fund or issue of debt instruments.
What disclosures need to be made?
SEBI’s regulations state that a social enterprise should submit an annual impact report in a prescribed format. The report must be audited by a social audit firm and has to be submitted within 90 days from the end of the financial year.
Listed NPOs, on a quarterly basis, are specifically required to furnish details about the money they have raised category-wise, how they have been utilised and the unutilised balance amount. The latter needs to be furbished until the proceeds are fully utilised or the purpose has been achieved.

NBA: Kevin Durant makes winning debut for Suns over Hornets,"CHARLOTTE – Devin Booker poured in 37 points and Kevin Durant’s National Basketball Association (NBA) debut with the Phoenix Suns came with huge contributions in a 105-91 road victory against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night.
Durant, who was in the starting lineup for his first action since Jan 8 with the Brooklyn Nets, racked up 23 points and six rebounds. He missed almost two months because of ligament strain in his right knee during which time he was traded to the Western Conference contenders.
Booker was 15-for-26 from the field. Deandre Ayton supplied 16 points and 16 rebounds.
While the Suns had an addition to the lineup, the Hornets had absences two nights after point guard LaMelo Ball was lost for the rest of the season because of a fracture in his right ankle. Starting forward P.J. Washington was out again with a foot injury.
Charlotte’s season-best five-game winning streak came to an end despite Kelly Oubre Jr.’s big second half to finish with 26 points. Terry Rozier scored 20 points, Gordon Hayward added 15 points and Mark Williams had 11 points and 10 rebounds.
Oubre rejoined the Charlotte starting lineup, but he went one-for-11 from the field in the first half.
Durant’s first basket with the Suns came on a drive down the left side of the lane. He ended up 10-for-15 from the field in 27 minutes.
The Hornets closed within 69-61 in the third quarter before Booker’s three-point play and three-point basket helped thwart that threat.
Phoenix led 79-73 after three quarters. Durant scored nine points in the first four-and-a-half minutes of the fourth quarter as the Suns built their lead to 91-80.
Durant had 12 points by halftime, when the Suns led 57-41. He made five of eight shots, including a pair of three-point baskets, in the first half. Ayton and Booker also scored 12 first-half points.

‘He has room to do something great’: What to expect from China’s next premier Li Qiang,"Analysts say that holding the trust of President Xi Jinping will grant Li Qiang a higher degree of autonomy in economic affairs, allowing him to take bold actions.

With Li Qiang poised to take the premiership baton that will put him firmly on track to run the world’s second-largest economy, the onlooking crowd is already debating and dissecting the big questions over his would-be role, work style, policies and priorities.
Historically, the 63-year-old has shown himself to be a pragmatist with a strong business-oriented mindset, but his relatively low profile until recently has left the market scrambling for signs or indications of how he would manage far more sophisticated domestic issues, while countering US decoupling pressure at the central-government level.
Li, as the most pro-business politician in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s inner circle, would shoulder the responsibility of shoring up the economy to previous levels of growth, defusing immediate risks, tapping into long-term growth potential and elevating China into a high-income economy during his tenure.
Many overseas analysts believed that Li, who was Xi’s de facto chief of staff in Zhejiang province from 2004 to 2007, will mainly play the role of implementer, rather than be tasked with reshaping the country’s development course.
“His main strengths are his long work as a close adviser to Xi Jinping,” said Andrew Collier, a China analyst with Global Source Partners.
Domestic scholars believe that holding the president’s trust will grant Li a higher degree of autonomy in economic affairs, allowing him to take bold actions to address the most pressing issues, such as shoring up private confidence.
“He has the room to do something great, but this all must be done under Xi’s overriding thoughts or within his tolerance,” said an independent Chinese economist who declined to be identified given the politically sensitive nature.

"Oil holds gains on China rebound, even as US crude stocks rise","FILE PHOTO: A view shows Chao Xing tanker at the crude oil terminal Kozmino on the shore of Nakhodka Bay near the port city of Nakhodka, Russia August 12, 2022. REUTERS/Tatiana Meel
bsSINGAPORE : Oil prices inched up in early Asian trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous two sessions on signs of a strong economic rebound in China, the world's top oil importer, which offset worries about a rise in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $84.43 a barrel at 0231 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 7 cents, or 0.1 per cent, at $77.76 a barrel.
Both contracts rose about 1 per cent in the previous session after data showed manufacturing activity in China in February grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade, adding to evidence of an economic rebound after the removal of strict COVID-19 curbs.
However a tenth consecutive week of crude stock builds in the United States capped the market's gains.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week ending Feb. 24 to 480.2 million barrels, their highest level since May 2021, the Energy Information Administration reported.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 500,000-barrel rise.
Record exports of U.S. crude oil, however, kept the build smaller than in recent weeks, with shipments rising to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to the EIA.
""U.S. crude inventories slowed their increases but sit at above the five-year range, with the slowdown of builds due to surging gross exports to new records,"" Citi analysts said in a client note.
Meanwhile, crude oil processed by Indian refiners reached record levels in January, provisional government data on Wednesday showed, as the country boosted imports of Russian barrels that Western countries shunned.

bsSINGAPORE : Oil prices inched up in early Asian trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous two sessions on signs of a strong economic rebound in China, the world's top oil importer, which offset worries about a rise in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $84.43 a barrel at 0231 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 7 cents, or 0.1 per cent, at $77.76 a barrel.
Both contracts rose about 1 per cent in the previous session after data showed manufacturing activity in China in February grew at the fastest pace in more than a decade, adding to evidence of an economic rebound after the removal of strict COVID-19 curbs.

Sporadic incidents of violence, alleged booth jamming and intimidation had marred the elections to the 60-member Tripura Assembly, where nearly 88% votes were polled. For the first time in Tripura’s history, the Election Commission has appointed a counting observer for each of the 60 Assembly constituencies.
Most of the Assembly seats are witnessing a three-corner contest, while some witnessed multi-corner contests. The run-up to the election also saw a 25-fold increase in seizures of cash, liquor, drugs, precious metals and freebies, together worth ₹44.67 crore.

BJP has put up the highest number of candidates (55) and given five seats to its junior partner Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT). IPFT however breached the agreement and put up its own candidate from another seat (41-Ampinagar) raising the number of seat it’s contesting to six.

Musk: 'AI stresses me out',"DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has clashed often with securities regulators and highway safety authorities, but there's one area the Tesla and Twitter chief says the government should regulate now: Artificial Intelligence.
""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said near the end of a more than three-hour presentation to Tesla investors about company plans.
Tesla's own ambitious artificial intelligence efforts had a featured role in the presentation of Musk's ""Master Plan 3"", the third part of a series of papers on how to expand Tesla and convert the world to clean energy.
There was a video of a Optimus humanoid robot, being developed by Tesla, manipulating parts of other Optimus robots as if it intended to assemble replicas of itself. Executives gave detailed presentations about how Tesla is using artificial intelligence technology to train vehicles to drive themselves - an effort under scrutiny by federal and state authorities.
But when asked by an analyst if AI could help Tesla build cars, Musk took a less optimistic line.
""I don't see AI helping us make cars any time soon,"" he said. ""At that point ... there's no point in any of us working.""
Earlier this week, Musk appeared to confirm via Twitter reports that he is recruiting a team of AI technologists to build a competitor to OpenAI's text-based ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft Corp, (MSFT.O) and similar systems under development at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and other large technology platforms.
Musk tweeted last December that ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, ""is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI."" He amplified those concerns for the audience of Tesla analysts Wednesday.
""I'm a little worried about the AI stuff,"" Musk said from a stage where he was flanked by 16 Tesla executives, including Autopilot head.
""We need some kind of, like, regulatory authority or something overseeing AI development,"" Musk said. ""Make sure it's operating in the public interest. It's quite dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it.""
Tesla's effort to enable its cars to drive themselves safely is ""obviously useful"" AI, Musk said.
""I don't know. Tesla is doing good things in AI,"" he said. Musk paused, then sighed. ""This one stresses me out. I don't know what to say about it.""

"Asian stocks rally sputters as China pulls back, higher U.S. yields weigh","· Summary
· Companies
· https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4
· China, Hong Kong opened lower, reversing yesterday's gains
· Tesla down over 5% after hours as Investor Day fails to excite
· Wall Street slumped into red after U.S. manufacturing PMI
· U.S. futures slide as Treasury yields hit fresh highs in Asia
SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - A rally in Asian shares sputtered on Thursday, pressured by a pullback in Chinese stocks and higher U.S. yields amid fears that global central banks would keep raising interest rates to combat sticky inflation.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) lost 0.3%, reversing some of the 2.1% gain in the previous session - the index's best day in two months. Japan's Nikkei (.N225), on the other hand, eased 0.2%.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) retreated 1.0%, after registering the biggest daily gain of 4.2% in nearly three months the previous day, buoyed by unexpectedly robust readings from China PMI surveys.
Investors' enthusiasm has faded somewhat over China's economic reopening after Beijing dismantled its strict COVID-19 controls in December, as analysts look for more evidence to gauge the pace of economic recovery.
U.S. futures erased earlier gains, with the S&P 500 stock futures falling 0.5% and Nasdaq futures down 0.7%.
Tesla shares (TSLA.O) slumped 5.5% in after-hour trading, after the Tesla Investor Day failed to excite investors. The company will cut vehicle assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors.
""Financial markets are caught between the two narratives of a softer landing, helped by China's reopening, and sticky inflation keeping policy rates higher for longer,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.
""That will probably keep bond markets on the back foot and FX markets volatile in ranges.""
Overnight, both bonds and shares took a battering, as inflation indicators from Germany and the United States reinforced expectations that interest rates would go higher and stay there for longer.
Data overnight showed no let-up in stubborn price pressures in Germany, after both Spain and France posted unexpected inflation rises on Tuesday. Germany's 2-year government bond yield rose to its highest since October 2008.
In the United States, manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth straight month in February, but a gauge of prices for raw materials increased last month, stoking concerns that inflation would remain stubborn.
""The PMI manufacturing data provides a mixed message for global risk appetite, with improving growth trends positive, but lower output prices stalling out,"" said Alan Ruskin, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank.
""In general, developed markets tend to have a worse balance than emerging markets, in so much as growth is weaker and inflation more sticky.""
On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a fresh four-month high of 4.0160%, after hitting 4% overnight. The two-year yields also advanced to 4.9080%, a fresh 15-year high.
Investors still mostly foresee the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting later this month, but expectations of a larger 50 basis points hike have increased. The probability that the Fed's policy rate, currently set in the 4.5% to 4.75% range, could peak above 5.5% range stood at 53%, compared with 41.5% on Feb. 28, according to CME Fed tool.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he was inclined ""to push up my policy path"" after a recent government report showed the Fed's preferred inflation index accelerated in January to a 5.4% annual rate, more than double the Fed's 2% target and slightly faster than the month before.
In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar index, measuring the greenback's value against a basket of major peers, gained 0.2% to 104.6.
The euro lost 0.2% to $1.0646, reversing some of a 0.8% gain overnight, with hotter-than-expected German inflation adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates.
In the crypto world, shares in Silvergate Capital (SI.N) plunged by as much as 28% after the cryptocurrency-focused bank said it was delaying its annual report and was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern.
Oil prices were largely steady on Thursday, having risen by 1% the previous day due to optimism over China's recovery. U.S. crude held at $77.67 a barrel. Brent crude was largely unchanged at $84.34 per barrel.

SYDNEY : A rally in Asian shares sputtered on Thursday, pressured by a pullback in Chinese stocks and higher U.S. yields amid fears that global central banks would keep raising interest rates to combat sticky inflation.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.3 per cent, reversing some of the 2.1 per cent gain in the previous session - the index's best day in two months. Japan's Nikkei, on the other hand, eased 0.2 per cent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index retreated 1.0 per cent, after registering the biggest daily gain of 4.2 per cent in nearly three months the previous day, buoyed by unexpectedly robust readings from China PMI surveys.
Investors' enthusiasm has faded somewhat over China's economic reopening after Beijing dismantled its strict COVID-19 controls in December, as analysts look for more evidence to gauge the pace of economic recovery.
U.S. futures erased earlier gains, with the S&P 500 stock futures falling 0.5 per cent and Nasdaq futures down 0.7 per cent.
Tesla shares slumped 5.5 per cent in after-hour trading, after the Tesla Investor Day failed to excite investors. The company will cut vehicle assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors.
""Financial markets are caught between the two narratives of a softer landing, helped by China's reopening, and sticky inflation keeping policy rates higher for longer,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.
""That will probably keep bond markets on the back foot and FX markets volatile in ranges.""
Overnight, both bonds and shares took a battering, as inflation indicators from Germany and the United States reinforced expectations that interest rates would go higher and stay there for longer.
Data overnight showed no let-up in stubborn price pressures in Germany, after both Spain and France posted unexpected inflation rises on Tuesday. Germany's 2-year government bond yield rose to its highest since October 2008.
In the United States, manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth straight month in February, but a gauge of prices for raw materials increased last month, stoking concerns that inflation would remain stubborn.
""The PMI manufacturing data provides a mixed message for global risk appetite, with improving growth trends positive, but lower output prices stalling out,"" said Alan Ruskin, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank.
""In general, developed markets tend to have a worse balance than emerging markets, in so much as growth is weaker and inflation more sticky.""
On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a fresh four-month high of 4.0160 per cent, after hitting 4 per cent overnight. The two-year yields also advanced to 4.9080 per cent, a fresh 15-year high.
Investors still mostly foresee the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting later this month, but expectations of a larger 50 basis points hike have increased. The probability that the Fed's policy rate, currently set in the 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent range, could peak above 5.5 per cent range stood at 53 per cent, compared with 41.5 per cent on Feb. 28, according to CME Fed tool.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he was inclined ""to push up my policy path"" after a recent government report showed the Fed's preferred inflation index accelerated in January to a 5.4 per cent annual rate, more than double the Fed's 2 per cent target and slightly faster than the month before.
In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar index, measuring the greenback's value against a basket of major peers, gained 0.2 per cent to 104.6.
The euro lost 0.2 per cent to $1.0646, reversing some of a 0.8 per cent gain overnight, with hotter-than-expected German inflation adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates.
In the crypto world, shares in Silvergate Capital plunged by as much as 28 per cent after the cryptocurrency-focused bank said it was delaying its annual report and was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern.
Oil prices were largely steady on Thursday, having risen by 1 per cent the previous day due to optimism over China's recovery. U.S. crude held at $77.67 a barrel. Brent crude was largely unchanged at $84.34 per barrel.

Musk: 'AI stresses me out',"FILE PHOTO: Tesla founder Elon Musk attends Offshore Northern Seas 2022 in Stavanger, Norway August 29, 2022. NTB/Carina Johansen via REUTERS
DETROIT : Elon Musk has clashed often with securities regulators and highway safety authorities, but there's one area the Tesla and Twitter chief says the government should regulate now: Artificial Intelligence.
""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said near the end of a more than three-hour presentation to Tesla investors about company plans.
Tesla's own ambitious artificial intelligence efforts had a featured role in the presentation of Musk's ""Master Plan 3"", the third part of a series of papers on how to expand Tesla and convert the world to clean energy.
There was a video of a Optimus humanoid robot, being developed by Tesla, manipulating parts of other Optimus robots as if it intended to assemble replicas of itself. Executives gave detailed presentations about how Tesla is using artificial intelligence technology to train vehicles to drive themselves - an effort under scrutiny by federal and state authorities.
But when asked by an analyst if AI could help Tesla build cars, Musk took a less optimistic line.
""I don't see AI helping us make cars any time soon,"" he said. ""At that point ... there's no point in any of us working.""
Earlier this week, Musk appeared to confirm via Twitter reports that he is recruiting a team of AI technologists to build a competitor to OpenAI's text-based ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft Corp, and similar systems under development at Alphabet Inc's Google, Meta Platforms Inc and other large technology platforms.
Musk tweeted last December that ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, ""is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI."" He amplified those concerns for the audience of Tesla analysts Wednesday.
""I'm a little worried about the AI stuff,"" Musk said from a stage where he was flanked by 16 Tesla executives, including Autopilot head.
""We need some kind of, like, regulatory authority or something overseeing AI development,"" Musk said. ""Make sure it's operating in the public interest. It's quite dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it.""
Tesla's effort to enable its cars to drive themselves safely is ""obviously useful"" AI, Musk said.
""I don't know. Tesla is doing good things in AI,"" he said. Musk paused, then sighed. ""This one stresses me out. I don't know what to say about it.""

Singapore ranks 6th for luxury home sales in 2022: Knight Frank,"SINGAPORE - Singapore ranks among the top markets for ultra-prime residential property transactions in 2022 alongside cities such as London and New York, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.
In Knight Frank’s Wealth Report released on Wednesday, Singapore ranked sixth among the top 10 cities in the high-end activity index, with 18 ultra-prime property sales valued at more than US$25 million (S$33.6 million) each and 121 super-prime property sales (valued at more than US$10 million each).
This comes even though transaction volumes of prime homes eased from the most recent high in 2021.
London topped the chart for high-end sales, with 43 ultra-prime and 223 super-prime transactions. New York was next, with 43 ultra-prime and 244 super-prime sales, while Los Angeles chalked up 39 ultra-prime and 225 super-prime deals.
Hong Kong came fourth, with 28 ultra-prime transactions and 125 super-prime deals. Hong Kong is also the second most expensive residential market, with 21 square metres (sq m) purchased for every US$1 million.
Monaco ranks as the most expensive residential market with 17 sq m per US$1 million. Singapore currently ties with London for the fourth position with 34 sq m of prime residential property bought for every US$1 million.
“Singapore continues to attract high-net worth homebuyers both domestically and from all over the world,” said Nicholas Keong, Knight Frank Singapore head of private office.
Mr Keong believes Singapore is seen as a safe haven by high-net worth individuals, as the government kept the economy and public health stable even in a period of global economic uncertainty and political tensions.
This year, Knight Frank expects a 4 per cent increase in prime prices in Singapore, amid upward pressure on property prices fuelled by a rising number of wealthy individuals.
The real estate consultancy noted that prime home prices in Singapore increased by “a relatively modest” 3.9 per cent in 2022, coming in at 58th place in Knight Frank’s Prime International Residential Index 100 (PIRI 100).
While the country is up from the 70th position in 2021, prime prices continued to lag behind the overall growth of 8.6 per cent for Singapore private residential properties, as well as behind the average increase of 5.2 per cent across residential cities in the PIRI 100.
Leonard Tay, Knight Frank Singapore head of research, attributes this to the government’s efforts in reining in runaway prices, with the measures preventing prices from overheating beyond the pace of economic performance and household incomes.
Travel restrictions imposed in other countries such as China and Hong Kong have also limited foreign investors’ interest in purchasing homes in Singapore until early 2023, Mr Tay said.
He believes it will take time before the easing of border restrictions translates into transaction activity in Singapore’s prime home market, given the dampening effect of additional buyer’s stamp duty for foreigners.",2023-03-02 02:34:59.017000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/aisgcondo0203.jpg?VersionId=b13aF4HKH8ZqOqwmSlLuNNl7Cf5.nWby,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singapore-ranks-6th-for-luxury-home-sales-in-2022-knight-frank,"Singapore ranks 6th for luxury home sales in 2022: Knight FrankSINGAPORE - Singapore ranks among the top markets for ultra-prime residential property transactions in 2022 alongside cities such as London and New York, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

"South Korea promises to boost exports, attract tourists","SEOUL, March 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's government on Thursday promised to boost exports and attract tourists as the country's statistics agency released January data that showed gloomy prospects for the economy.
Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho said at a meeting of officials the likelihood of a quick export recovery was limited but that government ministries would do their best to avert a decline in shipments to other markets.
He also said the government would work to attract more foreign tourists, with arrivals so far this year at about 40% of pre-COVID levels.
Reflecting the sense of urgency within the government, South Korea's trade minister convened a separate emergency meeting of officials from almost all ministries to press for more exports.
A statement quoted Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Lee Chang-yang as urging participants to ""find realistic ways and put every ounce of energy"" to increase exports.
South Korea's official forecast is for exports to drop 4.5% in 2023 compared with last year. Exports for January and February have already posted a 12% decline over a year earlier.
Statistics Korea data showed on Thursday that Asia's fourth-largest economy could be headed for a recession with the cyclically adjusted coincident index - calculated from several current economic indicators - falling in January for a fourth consecutive month.
Industrial output rose in January from the previous month but plunged on the year, while retail sales decreased for a third consecutive month, the data showed.
South Korea's trade-reliant economy contracted by an estimated 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the previous quarter as exports collapsed.

"S&P, Nasdaq weak as manufacturing stokes Fed concerns","· Summary
· Companies
· Two-year Treasury yield jumps to 2007 high
· Novavax slumps on going concern worries
· Tesla slips ahead of investor day
NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell for a second straight session on Wednesday as Treasury yields jumped after manufacturing data indicated inflation is likely to remain stubbornly high, while comments from Federal Reserve policymakers supported a hawkish policy stance.
The yield on 10-year notes topped 4% for the first time since November, reaching a high of 4.01%, after the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in February and prices for raw materials increased last month.
After the data was released, the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, gained on the day after reaching 4.904%, its highest since 2007. It was last up 8.4 basis points at 4.881%.
""You could see the market kind of deteriorated a little bit, yields started climbing after that February ISM manufacturing report. Prices paid component, that really jumped, broke a four-month streak of price declines,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, referring to the ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid Index which is seen as an inflation indicator.

· Two-year Treasury yield jumps to 2007 high
· Novavax slumps on going concern worries
· Tesla slips ahead of investor day
NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell for a second straight session on Wednesday as Treasury yields jumped after manufacturing data indicated inflation is likely to remain stubbornly high, while comments from Federal Reserve policymakers supported a hawkish policy stance.
The yield on 10-year notes topped 4% for the first time since November, reaching a high of 4.01%, after the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in February and prices for raw materials increased last month.
After the data was released, the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, gained on the day after reaching 4.904%, its highest since 2007. It was last up 8.4 basis points at 4.881%.
""You could see the market kind of deteriorated a little bit, yields started climbing after that February ISM manufacturing report. Prices paid component, that really jumped, broke a four-month streak of price declines,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, referring to the ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid Index which is seen as an inflation indicator.
""That is just another piece of evidence we have seen over the past couple of weeks that inflation is remaining stickier than what most people thought in January,"" he said, adding it was likely the Fed is going to move rates higher.

"Van Dijk, Salah steer Liverpool to 2-0 win over Wolves","LIVERPOOL: Virgil van Dijk and forward Mohamed Salah scored second-half goals as Liverpool battled to a 2-0 Premier League home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday (Mar 1) to boost their hopes of European football next season.
Liverpool climbed into sixth spot in the table on 39 points, ahead of Fulham on goal difference and with a game in hand, but the home side were forced to work hard on a rainy night at Anfield.
""We controlled the game without creating massively, but we found our rhythm back,"" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said in a TV interview as his side claimed their third win in an unbeaten four-game Premier League run.
Despite fashioning the first effort on goal in the game, the visitors suffered an early blow when left back Hugo Bueno went down clutching his hamstring midway through the first half and was replaced by Rayan Ait-Nouri.
The best chances of the opening 45 minutes fell to teenaged Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott, who steered a header just wide in the 39th minute and followed that up with a bouncing stoppage-time shot that was turned away for a corner.
The 19-year-old was in the thick of things again 10 minutes into the second half, controlling a firm pass from Darwin Nunez and firing another shot goalwards, but again it lacked the necessary power and precision and was easily saved by Jose Sa.
Nunez had the ball in the net for the home side in the 66th minute after a surging run by Diogo Jota, but the Portuguese striker was deemed to have fouled Max Kilman in the build-up after a VAR review and the goal was chalked off.
Van Dijk finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute, forcing a save with his initial header from a set-piece, before Jota put the rebound back across the goal for the Dutchman to head home from close range.
Four minutes later Salah used his right thigh to steer home a cross from Kostas Tsimikas to double his side's advantage and take the wind out of the visitors' sails as Liverpool cruised to victory, much to the delight of the home fans.
""You have to break an opponent down step by step, it's not often they make mistakes and you get easy goals in the 420 or something games I've had here,"" Klopp said.
His side now face a resurgent Manchester United, who are 10 points ahead of Liverpool in third spot, on Sunday.

Record retail theft puts pressure on Australian supermarket giants,"SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Retail theft has hit record levels in Australia, government statistics show, putting pressure on grocery giants Woolworths Group Ltd (WOW.AX) and Coles Group Ltd (COL.AX) that are already struggling with soaring supply costs and freight blockages.
Store theft rose 23.7% in New South Wales, the home state of a third of Australians, from 2021 to 2022, state government figures showed on Thursday, the fastest year-on-year increase since records began in 1995.
Queensland, Australia's third-largest state, had the highest monthly rate of shop stealing on record this January, according to publicly available police data. Neither state's data specified which retailers reported theft.
The data underscores concerns raised by analysts and social researchers that surging living costs - from grocery shelf prices to power bills to mortgages - will drive up crime. That may impact profit at Woolworths and Coles, which together ring up two-thirds of Australian grocery sales and noted rising store theft in trading updates last month.
""We would see a risk that that continues to rise if and when we start to see an increase in unemployment and tougher economic conditions,"" said Craig Woolford, a retail analyst at MST Marquee.
""Supermarkets operate on very thin profit margins. You only need a small change in the stock loss to have an impact on profitability,"" he added. Supermarkets refer to goods lost to theft, expiry or payment error as stock losses.
Woolworths and Coles declined to comment. On a Feb. 22 earnings call with analysts, Coles Chief Operating Officer Matt Swindells said the company was experiencing ""elevated theft"" and was investing in staff training and technology to counteract it. read more

BOJ's Takata: Must 'patiently' maintain ultra-loose policy,"TOKYO : Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member Hajime Takata said on Thursday the central bank must ""patiently"" maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy, as Japan has yet to see inflation sustainably hit the bank's 2 per cent target backed by wage hikes.
While Japan's economy is headed for a moderate recovery, it faced risks such as slowing global demand that could discourage companies from raising wages, Takata said.

""While we need to be mindful of the impact of our massive stimulus programe on market function, we're at a stage where we need to patiently maintain monetary easing,"" he said.

Chinese tourists have once again started arriving at Japanese airports, but there is concern the influx of arrivals will cause a major strain to the country’s travel industry that is dealing with a pandemic-induced labour shortage.
Tokyo on Wednesday scrapped a testing requirement for Chinese arrivals imposed on December 30, following concerns about imported coronavirus infections as the mainland suddenly began unravelling its strict zero-Covid policy.

China warns ‘hedonistic’ bankers to toe the Communist Party line,"BEIJING – Bankers in China are being told to rectify their mindsets, clean up their “hedonistic” lifestyles and stop copying Western ways.
The directives, part of a 3,500-word commentary last week from the country’s top anti-graft watchdog, is just the latest sign that President Xi Jinping’s campaign to tighten the Communist Party’s grip on the financial system has a long way to go.
As the National People’s Congress kicks off this weekend, Mr Xi is poised to further entrench control by reviving a powerful committee to coordinate economic and financial policy and installing close allies to oversee it all.
That comes on the heels of the sudden disappearance of one of China’s top investment bankers and follows the downfall of dozens of officials over the past 18 months in the most sweeping corruption crackdown on financial sector ever.
In its warning last week, China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said bankers should abandon pretensions of being the “financial elite”.
“All of these development speak to one thing: the Communist Party will govern everything, including economic and financial work,” said Mr Shen Meng, a director of Beijing-based investment bank Chanson & Co. “Policy makers are placing the finance industry at the heart of the economy as a lubricant for its smooth development, and if the economy goes sour, the sector is mainly to blame.”
This is a critical moment for Mr Xi as he seeks to reign in risks in the $60 trillion financial sector (S$80.7 trillion) – imposing stricter controls on capital outflow, controlling debt levels and ruling out risky practices – while he tries to restore growth and manage the economic fallout of spiralling ties with the US.
Aiming criticism at the industry may well provide Mr Xi with convenient cover if that doesn’t go smoothly.
The National People’s Congress – where top leaders will assess the government’s past performance and outline policies for the year ahead – offers Mr Xi his first opportunity to shake up state institutions since he secured a precedent-breaking third term at the party’s twice-a-decade congress.
China’s top leaders have typically used the first parliament meeting after a congress to reorganise critical government organs. In 2018, Mr Xi carried out the most extensive overhaul in decades in a revamp that solidified his control over key functions.
‘Broker Butcher’
Authorities are considering reviving the long-disbanded Central Financial Work Commission to allow the ruling Communist Party to assert more control, according to people familiar with the matter.
The commission is set to be headed by Mr Ding Xuexiang, Xi’s chief of staff, one of the people said. Mr He Lifeng, who is expected to become China’s new vice premier, is also being considered for the role of party secretary at the People’s Bank of China, according to the Wall Street Journal.
As part of changing of the guard, the nation’s securities regulator is poised to get a new chairman nicknamed “the broker butcher,” people familiar with the matter said earlier. Mr Wu Qing, a vice mayor of Shanghai, earned his reputation cracking down on wayward traders while at the regulator in the mid-2000s, shuttering 31 firms.
At the same time, the financial industry has been rocked by the disappearance of Mr Bao Fan – who oversaw some of the nation’s biggest tech deals over the past decade.

Australia's Nitro Software recommends $360 million Potentia offer,":Australia's Nitro Software Ltd on Thursday recommended its shareholders accept private equity firm Potentia Capital's sweetened takeover offer of A$532.3 million ($359.78 million), weeks after they rejected a A$526.9 million offer from Alludo.
Nitro shareholders early last month rejected Alludo's A$2.15 per-share bid, after which Potentia hinted at hiking its offer, securing access to the software company's books and making a A$2.17 apiece offer last week.
Nitro said it now considers Potentia's latest offer to be ""superior"" to Alludo's, and unanimously recommends shareholders accept it in the absence of any other better offer.
Potentia, which has a 19.31 per cent stake in Nitro, also said its offer could go as high as A$2.25 per share if it obtained a 75 per cent stake in Nitro by March-end and if at least 25 per cent of total Nitro shareholders accepted a scrip offer, Nitro added.
Alludo did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Alludo and Potentia have been vying for Nitro since late last year, as high inflation, weak consumer demand and the Ukraine crisis slammed technology stocks in particular, setting them up as buyout targets.
Shares of Nitro rose as much as 0.5 per cent to A$2.190, while the broader market was slightly down.

Record retail theft puts pressure on Australian supermarket giants,"SYDNEY : Retail theft has hit record levels in Australia, government statistics show, putting pressure on grocery giants Woolworths Group Ltd and Coles Group Ltd that are already struggling with soaring supply costs and freight blockages.
Store theft rose 23.7 per cent in New South Wales, the home state of a third of Australians, from 2021 to 2022, state government figures showed on Thursday, the fastest year-on-year increase since records began in 1995.
Queensland, Australia's third-largest state, had the highest monthly rate of shop stealing on record this January, according to publicly available police data. Neither state's data specified which retailers reported theft.
The data underscores concerns raised by analysts and social researchers that surging living costs - from grocery shelf prices to power bills to mortgages - will drive up crime. That may impact profit at Woolworths and Coles, which together ring up two-thirds of Australian grocery sales and noted rising store theft in trading updates last month.
""We would see a risk that that continues to rise if and when we start to see an increase in unemployment and tougher economic conditions,"" said Craig Woolford, a retail analyst at MST Marquee.
""Supermarkets operate on very thin profit margins. You only need a small change in the stock loss to have an impact on profitability,"" he added. Supermarkets refer to goods lost to theft, expiry or payment error as stock losses.
Woolworths and Coles declined to comment. On a Feb. 22 earnings call with analysts, Coles Chief Operating Officer Matt Swindells said the company was experiencing ""elevated theft"" and was investing in staff training and technology to counteract it.
Australia's jobless rate rose in January to its highest since May after nine interest rate rises that are designed to slow inflation, currently running near 8 per cent.

Taiwan reports second day of large Chinese incursion into its air defence zone,"TAIPEI - Taiwan reported on Thursday a second day of a large scale Chinese air force incursion into its air defence zone, with its defence ministry saying that in the past 24 hours it had spotted 21 aircraft, as part of Beijing’s ongoing military pressure campaign.
Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, has complained for the past three years or so of stepped up Chinese military activities near the island as Beijing seeks to assert its sovereignty claims.
China has said its activities in the area are justified as it seeks to defend its territorial integrity and to warn the United States against “colluding” with Taiwan, despite the anger this causes in Taipei.
Taiwan’s defence ministry said the aircraft, 17 J-10 fighters and four J-16 fighters, had flown into the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, according to a map the ministry released.
The J-10s, an older fighter model that first entered service two decades ago, flew closer to the Chinese coast than Taiwan’s, while the J-16s, a much newer and more advanced fighter, flew in an area to the northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, the map showed.
The lightly-defended Pratas are strategically located at the top of the South China Sea and many of China’s fly-bys happen nearby.
Taiwan’s forces monitored the situation, including sending up its own air force planes, the ministry added, using the normal phrasing for its response to such Chinese incursions.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida, March 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX was ready to try again at sending NASA's next long-duration crew of the International Space Station to orbit on Thursday, about 72 hours after a first attempt was scrubbed due to a clogged filter in the launch system.
Two NASA astronauts will be joined by a Russian cosmonaut and an astronaut from the United Arab Emirates for a six-month science mission made up of experiments ranging from human cell growth in space to controlling combustible materials in microgravity.
The SpaceX launch vehicle, consisting of a Falcon 9 rocket topped with an autonomously operated Crew Dragon capsule called Endeavour, was set for liftoff at 12:34 a.m. EST (0534 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
The four-man crew should reach the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting some 250 miles (420 km) above Earth, about 25 hours after launch, early on Friday morning.
Monday's initial attempt to send the crew to space was called off less than three minutes before liftoff time when launch teams detected a problem in the flow of engine-ignition fluid used to start the rocket's main thrusters. NASA said the issue was remedied by replacing a clogged filter and purging the system.
NASA said on Wednesday the mission was ""go"" for launch with a 95% chance of favorable weather conditions.
""All systems are looking good for launch,"" though teams were keeping an eye on weather along the spacecraft's ascent path, SpaceX said on Twitter.
Designated Crew 6, the mission marks the sixth long-term ISS team that NASA has flown aboard SpaceX since the private rocket venture founded by Musk - billionaire CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and social media platform Twitter - began sending American astronauts to orbit in May 2020.
The latest ISS crew is led by mission commander Stephen Bowen, 59, a onetime U.S. Navy submarine officer who has logged more than 40 days in orbit as a veteran of three space shuttle flights and seven spacewalks.
Fellow NASA astronaut Warren ""Woody"" Hoburg, 37, an engineer and commercial aviator designated as the Crew 6 pilot, will be making his first spaceflight.
Crew 6 also is notable for its inclusion of UAE astronaut Sultan Alneyadi, 41, only the second person from his country to fly to space and the first to launch from U.S. soil as part of a long-duration space station team.
Rounding out the four-man Crew 6 is Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev, 42, who like Alneyadi is an engineer and spaceflight rookie designated as a mission specialist for the team.
Fedyaev is the latest cosmonaut to fly aboard an American spacecraft under a ride-sharing deal signed in July by NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, despite heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Crew 6 team will be welcomed aboard the space station by seven current ISS occupants - three U.S. NASA crew members, including commander Nicole Aunapu Mann, the first Native American woman to fly to space, along with three Russians and a Japanese astronaut.
The ISS, about the length of a football field and the largest human-made object in space, has been continuously operated for more than two decades by a U.S.-Russian-led consortium that includes Canada, Japan and 11 European countries.

"Stokes will be 'sweet' for Ashes, says McCullum","FILE PHOTO: Cricket - Third Test - England v South Africa - The Oval, London, Britain - September 12, 2022 England head coach Brendon McCullum after the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers
England coach Brendon McCullum says he has no concerns that Ben Stokes playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) will jeopardise the captain's participation in this year's Ashes series.
A knee issue has long bothered Stokes and he has come under pressure in some quarters to rest the joint and skip his lucrative stint in the IPL with the Chennai Super Kings from the end of the month.
McCullum, however, said the all-rounder had built a career on peaking in big moments and the Ashes series against Australia in June and July would be no different.
""I ... believe that the Ashes is the script that the skipper is waiting to write, so he'll be sweet. I don't have any concerns,"" he told reporters in Wellington at the conclusion of the drawn series with New Zealand.
""I don't think he's jeopardising it. I know that Chennai set-up, I played for that franchise, and it is excellent in looking after the players.
""He knows how to get right for the big moments. His life is that, right? When he comes back into the fold and leads us into the Ashes campaign, he'll have the bit between his teeth and I think we'll be all right.""
Stokes has already said he will leave the IPL early to prepare for a one-off test against Ireland at Lord's on June 1 and the first Ashes test at Edgbaston, which starts on June 16.
McCullum and Stokes have led England to 10 wins in 12 tests since taking over early last year on the back of an entertaining style of play dubbed ""Bazball"" after the coach's nickname.
The second defeat came in the most dramatic of circumstances on Tuesday when New Zealand triumphed by a single run to become only the fourth team to win a test after being asked to follow on.
McCullum, like Stokes, was unapologetic for the decision to enforce the follow on and said there was unlikely to be much change to the way England approached the game.
""I think there'll be tens of millions of people around the world that sat back and enjoyed that test match,"" he added.
""Now we have the opportunity to really ... turn our attention to what's going to be a pretty amazing time in the guys' lives - an Ashes series at home against a good Australian side.
""We'll go into it with a lot of confidence. We know it's not going to be easy, but I'm pretty sure we will play a very similar style of cricket that we've played throughout the last eight or nine months. And with eight or nine months of development of that style under our belt, we should be hard to beat.""",2023-03-02 01:52:42.827000+00:00,"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--Os5hh-_1--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-03-02t014337z_1_lynxmpej2101o_rtroptp_3_cricket-test-nzl-eng.jpg?itok=IG2mLJK5",CNA,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/stokes-will-be-sweet-ashes-says-mccullum-3317386,"Stokes will be 'sweet' for Ashes, says McCullumFILE PHOTO: Cricket - Third Test - England v South Africa - The Oval, London, Britain - September 12, 2022 England head coach Brendon McCullum after the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers

Xi Jinping's economic thought steers China toward modernity,"Cranes load and unload cargos for freighters at Yantai Port in Yantai, east China's Shandong Province, Jan. 17, 2023. (Photo by Tang Ke/Xinhua)
* ""Toward Modernity: The Value of Xi Jinping's Economic Thought"" expounds on the rich connotations of Xi Jinping's economic thought from the philosophical, strategic and tactical dimensions as well as its implications for the world, and explores the origins of the thought in practice.
* Xi Jinping's economic thought highlights basing on the new development stage, applying the new development philosophy and building a new pattern of development.
* Xi Jinping's economic thought offers the best starting point for the world to observe China's economy, understand China's model and draw on China's experience.
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- New China Research, the think tank of Xinhua News Agency, on Wednesday released a report titled ""Toward Modernity: The Value of Xi Jinping's Economic Thought.""
The report expounds on the rich connotations of Xi Jinping's economic thought from the philosophical, strategic and tactical dimensions as well as its implications for the world, and explores the origins of the thought in practice.
Following the guidance of Xi Jinping's economic thought, marching forward in tandem and fostering strong synergy for development, is key for the Chinese economy to forge ahead at its current stage and in the future, and is the source of assurance for overcoming challenges and advancing with full strength, says the report.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
The report focuses on the distinctive features of Xi Jinping's economic thought. It expounds on how Xi Jinping's economic thought pursues innovation on the basis of what has worked in the past, and opens up new frontiers for the Marxist political economics with five key points: a better life, the real economy, effective governance, harmonious development and common prosperity.
Xi Jinping's economic thought starts from the principal contradiction facing Chinese society, coordinates needs and wants, focuses on a ""better life,"" and establishes the economics that seeks happiness for people, the report says.
It also starts from the labor theory of value, coordinates the dual implications of economics and philosophy on value, focuses on the ""real economy,"" and establishes the economics that lays a stronger material foundation for national rejuvenation.
Based on laws of economics and reality, Xi Jinping's economic thought has created a synergy between the government and the markets while focusing on achieving ""effective governance"" and constructing socialist market economics in a new era, says the report.
Starting from new stage of development, Xi Jinping's economic thought creates a synergy between economy and society, between humans and nature, and between materials and culture, with a focus on achieving ""harmonious development"" and establishing peace for all future generations, the report says.
It also starts from the essence of socialism, coordinates efficiency and fairness, focuses on ""common prosperity,"" and constructs the economics of common prosperity and a harmonized world.

Over the past decade, China's economic strength has seen a historic rise, with the country's GDP growing from 54 trillion yuan (about 7.78 trillion U.S. dollars) to 121 trillion yuan, ranking second in the world. Over the past three years, China managed to achieve an average annual growth of 4.5 percent, far exceeding the global average.
The historic achievements and historic changes of the Chinese economy in the new era serve as a profound indication for the great strength of Xi Jinping's economic thought in practice, says the report.
HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENT
The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward that ""to build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must, first and foremost, pursue high-quality development."" One of the essential requirements for solidly promoting the Chinese path to modernization is pursuing high-quality development.
Wednesday's think tank report says that from a strategic dimension, Xi Jinping's economic thought highlights basing on the new development stage, applying the new development philosophy and building a new pattern of development. Themed on high-quality development, it points out the practical path for striving to press ahead with the Chinese path to modernization.
To fully grasp the new development stage, it is imperative to use the ""golden key"" of high-quality development to promote the effective improvement of quality and reasonable growth of quantity, says the report.
In the coming period, the characteristics of China's domestic market-led economic flows will become more obvious, and the potential of domestic demand will continue to be unleashed to boost economic growth.
China has the confidence to enhance its viability, competitiveness, development and sustainability, according to the report.
CHINESE WISDOM
Based on a full understanding of the fast-changing world from a historical perspective, Xi Jinping's economic thought creatively poses the task of boosting sound development of economic globalization, the report says.
From the strategic perspective of building a community with a shared future for humanity, the thought calls for steering economic globalization to see it become more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, it says.

Against a backdrop in which the COVID-19 pandemic deals a heavy blow and the development agenda is being politicized and marginalized, Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI). Since then, the GDI has won the support of more than 100 countries and international organizations, and close to 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI.
The report points out that China has been making development a top priority and proven that problems arising from development can only be solved through development.
The great achievements of China's economy in the new era are the best interpretation of the wisdom behind Xi Jinping's economic thought in economic governance of a major country, according to the report.
China has always placed its own development in the broad picture of human development, says the report, adding that Xi Jinping's economic thought offers the best starting point for the world to observe China's economy, understand China's model and draw on China's experience. ■",2023-03-02 01:44:59.518000+00:00,,Xinhua,https://english.news.cn/20230302/02cfe146d7224dc589c6c4431c46b2a8/c.html,"Xi Jinping's economic thought steers China toward modernityCranes load and unload cargos for freighters at Yantai Port in Yantai, east China's Shandong Province, Jan. 17, 2023.

The company informed the store’s employees on Wednesday that the location would be closing immediately, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The store was open for business on Wednesday morning, and a copy of its website from the previous day showed no plans for it to change business hours or close.
After employees were informed of the plan, Apple updated its website to show that the location – at the Northlake Mall in Mecklenburg County – would be shuttered permanently.
The shootings at the mall contributed to the decision, the people said.
Apple told employees that there will be no layoffs and that staff at the Northlake Mall site would be transferred to the nearby South Park location in Charlotte or roles working at the company’s online store.
The iPhone maker is also opening a new location in Charlotte next year to replace the Northlake Mall store. Plans for that store were already in the works before the recent shootings.
Apple confirmed the closure, but declined to comment further on the reasoning.
“In preparation for a new store we plan to open in the Charlotte area early next year, we will be closing Apple Northlake on March 2,” the company said in a statement.
“All of our team members will continue to support our Charlotte customers at Apple SouthPark and the Apple store online.”
Apple, which operates about 270 retail locations in the US, rarely closes stores, and the quick nature of the shutdown makes it all the more unusual.
According to local news reports, shots were fired outside a Macy’s at the Northlake Mall on Tuesday, while another shooting took place in early February. There were additional shootings reported in December and in 2021.

California fertility clinic sued for using embryo with deadly cancer gene,"LOS ANGELES - A California couple sued a Pasadena-based fertility clinic on Wednesday, saying it allegedly implanted an embryo carrying a rare gene that causes deadly stomach cancer and then falsified records to cover up its mistake.
In their lawsuit against HRC Fertility, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Jason and Melissa Diaz said their son, now a year old, will require total stomach removal surgery as a young adult to prevent or treat the cancer. They said they went to HRC Fertility specifically to avoid having a child with the gene, which Mr Diaz carries.
Mr Diaz had total stomach removal in 2018 after developing the rare cancer, known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, and two of his aunts died of stomach cancer in their 40s, according to the lawsuit, which also names the HRC doctor who worked with the couple, Bradford Kolb, as a defendant.
“We went to HRC Fertility to break the family curse of cancer and early death,” he said in a statement. “Trusting Dr Kolb and HRC turned out to be the biggest mistake of our lives.”
In 2020, Mrs Diaz had her eggs retrieved, and those eggs were used to create embryos that were tested for the gene. Dr Kolb transferred one embryo without the gene in 2020, but that pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, according to the lawsuit.
An HRC employee then told Mrs Diaz that they had another embryo without the gene, and she responded that the couple wanted to transfer that embryo. In fact, the employee was wrong and the embryo did carry the gene, the lawsuit said.
In January 2021, Dr Kolb transferred the embryo. The Diazes said they did not learn that their son carried the gene until after he was born that September, when they saw it mentioned in handwritten notes on a report of the January 2021 transfer.
Mrs Diaz then requested her medical records, and HRC produced a “falsified” version with the handwritten notes removed, according to the lawsuit.
“We deeply empathise with this family’s situation,” HRC said in a statement, adding that the Diazes “wished to have a male embryo transferred, which we carried out according to the family’s explicit wishes and in accordance with the highest level of care”.
The company did not further address the allegations in the lawsuit.

Covid-19 transmissible between dogs: Study,"SEOUL - A South Korean research team has confirmed on Wednesday that some Covid-19 variants, including Delta and Omicron, can be transmitted between dogs.
Although there have been many reports on the transmission of the coronavirus from humans to dogs, this is the first study that proves transmission of the virus among dogs.
The study, done by a joint research team, is led by Professor Song Dae-sub of Seoul National University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and researcher Yoo Kwang-soo of Jeonbuk National University.
The research team infected a beagle with the Delta and Omicron variants by introducing the virus through the dog’s nose. After 24 hours, they put an uninfected dog in the same cage.
Researchers did not detect any visible symptoms in the infected and uninfected dog, after observing them for seven days.
They only detected symptoms of viral pneumonia, a common symptom of Covid-19, when they analysed the tissue of the dogs’ lungs.
The team also found that proliferative viruses can be spread through dogs’ nasal discharge.
The study suggested that human coronaviruses such as Covid-19 and Mers can be transmitted to other species.
The research team suggested that pet vaccinations should be actively considered to prevent animal-to-human infection and the emergence of another variant from pets.
“If infection between species and individuals is repeated, the possibility of another variant increases,” said Prof Song.
“It is time to consider the use of animal vaccines to prevent the reverse zoonosis of pets.”
Reverse zoonosis refers to an infection or disease that is transmissible from humans to animals.

Murders of two women spark backlash in China against marriage,"BEIJING - Two high-profile murders of women have provoked a backlash on Chinese social media over the government’s promotion of marriage, with many people arguing that women are afforded too little protection from domestic violence.
A 24-year-old woman in rural Henan province was stabbed to death by her husband during a “family dispute” last week, after which he was arrested, authorities said on Monday.
In the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong, the dismembered remains of 28-year-old socialite and model, Abby Choi, were found last week, leading to the arrest of her ex-husband and two of his family members on suspicion of murder.
The murders of the women from opposite ends of the social spectrum rocked social media, with a growing number of people questioning government calls for marriage and more babies to offset a demographic crisis in rapidly aging China.
“If you don’t get married, you’re beaten by your boyfriend. If you’re married, your husband beats you. If you’re divorced, your ex-husband beats you. What has become of this world?“ one member of the public wrote on the Weibo platform.
“Not marrying and not having kids is indeed the safest,” said another person who posted.
The Weibo hashtag “24-year-old woman died after being stabbed eight times by her husband” logged more than 200 million views on Tuesday alone. Media said the victim in Henan, surnamed Yang, had two young children.
Social media videos circulating on Monday showed dozens of angry residents of the victim’s hometown clashing with police, although Reuters was unable to verify the location of the footage.
Outrage and debate
Traditional notions of marriage and family obligations remain strong in China even though many younger people are beginning to question this, citing unaffordable childcare, inadequate support for working mothers and individualistic aspirations.
This is partly reflected in a rising divorce rate.
Some social media posters highlighted the difficulty of leaving abusive marriages after the introduction in 2021 of a mandatory 30-day “cooling-off period” for couples wishing to divorce.
Many also criticised “prioritising men over women”, a conservative mindset common in parts of rural China, which gave rise to a stark gender imbalance in China’s population due to sex-selective abortions during decades of the one-child policy.
The country has about 722 million males compared to 690 million females, leaving millions of “bare branch” bachelors unable to wed.

"Tesla plans to halve production costs, affordable car a no show","SAN FRANCISCO: Tesla Inc will cut assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors on Wednesday (Mar 1), but Chief Executive Elon Musk did not unveil a much-awaited small, affordable electric vehicle.
Shares fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trade following presentations at the company's investor day from its Texas headquarters. A question-and-answer program will follow.
In the first nearly three hours of the webcast, Tesla executives led by Musk discussed everything from a white-paper plan for the globe to embrace sustainable energy to the company's innovation in managing its operations from manufacturing to service.
The presentation featured an array of engineers, a nod to Tesla's attempt to show the depth of its executive bench beyond Musk, the face of the company. Tom Zhu, the new global production chief, took the stage and said Tesla's global capacity was 2 million vehicles a year.
Musk had been expected to lay out a plan to make a small, affordable electric vehicle (EV) that would broaden his brand's appeal and fend off competition, but by late in the presentation executives had not detailed new vehicle model plans or new financial targets for the year.
Tesla's chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, estimated the company would need to invest six times more than it has to date to hit its long-term target of increasing output to 20 million vehicles annually, a 10-fold increase from current capacity. The bill could be US$175 billion, he said.
Musk began the question-and-answer section by announcing a new Tesla factory would be built in northern Mexico. On Tuesday, Mexican officials announced that Tesla would build a factory in the northern state of Nuevo Leon. It would be the company's first factory outside of the United States, Germany and China.
Tesla stock is down about half from their November 2021 peaks, but has rebounded more than 60 per cent this year.
MASS MARKET
Capturing the mass market is critical to Tesla's goal of 20 million vehicles in annual production by 2030.
Tesla already has a significant lead over its rivals in manufacturing EVs at a profit. Chief Engineer Lars Moravy said the company expects to build its next-generation vehicles for half the cost of the current Model 3 or Model Y.
Moravy described a production process for future EVs he called an ""unboxed"" model that would deliver lower costs by snapping together sub-assemblies and reducing complexity and time in assembly.
Tesla executive Peter Bannon gave an example of how the company uses data to cut costs. Customer data showed Tesla owners did not use the sunroof, he said, ""so we removed it"".
High-profile Tesla investor Ross Gerber tweeted that the presentation amounted to a ""huge tease"" on the next-generation vehicle. ""It's coming. They laid it all out. 50 per cent less cost to build. Would get you a US$25000-$30000 EV!""
Tesla is also opening up its charging stations to other brands of EVs, with the first 10 US Supercharger sites opening to non-Teslas on Tuesday. Executives said the company also was focused on developing charging infrastructure in commercial parking, beyond the Supercharger network.
Tesla has outperformed the industry in recent years, increasing deliveries rapidly despite the pandemic and supply-chain disruptions.
But Tesla cut prices in recent months to boost sales, which were pressured by a weak economy and growing threats from rivals in the United States and China.
The automaker has only four models, all priced toward the higher end of the market. The Cybertruck pickup is coming this year, executives said.
Tesla will also have to improve its battery technology, which Musk has called the ""fundamental limiting factor"" for the transition to sustainable energy.
In 2020, Musk unveiled a plan to develop batteries in-house, which he said would make self-driving electric cars priced at US$25,000 feasible by 2023, but Tesla has been struggling to scale up the production of the so-called 4680 batteries.
Executives on Wednesday said Tesla plans to start production of battery materials factories this year, with a lithium refinery and a cathode facility in Texas.

The presentation featured an array of engineers, a nod to Tesla's attempt to show the depth of its executive bench beyond Musk, the face of the company. Tom Zhu, the new global production chief, took the stage and said Tesla's global capacity was 2 million vehicles a year.
Musk had been expected to lay out a plan to make a small, affordable electric vehicle (EV) that would broaden his brand's appeal and fend off competition, but by late in the presentation executives had not detailed new vehicle model plans or new financial targets for the year.
Tesla's chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, estimated the company would need to invest six times more than it has to date to hit its long-term target of increasing output to 20 million vehicles annually, a 10-fold increase from current capacity. The bill could be US$175 billion, he said.
Musk began the question-and-answer section by announcing a new Tesla factory would be built in northern Mexico. On Tuesday, Mexican officials announced that Tesla would build a factory in the northern state of Nuevo Leon. It would be the company's first factory outside of the United States, Germany and China.
Tesla stock is down about half from their November 2021 peaks, but has rebounded more than 60 per cent this year.
MASS MARKET
Capturing the mass market is critical to Tesla's goal of 20 million vehicles in annual production by 2030.
Tesla already has a significant lead over its rivals in manufacturing EVs at a profit. Chief Engineer Lars Moravy said the company expects to build its next-generation vehicles for half the cost of the current Model 3 or Model Y.
Moravy described a production process for future EVs he called an ""unboxed"" model that would deliver lower costs by snapping together sub-assemblies and reducing complexity and time in assembly.
Tesla executive Peter Bannon gave an example of how the company uses data to cut costs. Customer data showed Tesla owners did not use the sunroof, he said, ""so we removed it"".
High-profile Tesla investor Ross Gerber tweeted that the presentation amounted to a ""huge tease"" on the next-generation vehicle. ""It's coming. They laid it all out. 50 per cent less cost to build. Would get you a US$25000-$30000 EV!""
Tesla is also opening up its charging stations to other brands of EVs, with the first 10 US Supercharger sites opening to non-Teslas on Tuesday. Executives said the company also was focused on developing charging infrastructure in commercial parking, beyond the Supercharger network.
Tesla has outperformed the industry in recent years, increasing deliveries rapidly despite the pandemic and supply-chain disruptions.
But Tesla cut prices in recent months to boost sales, which were pressured by a weak economy and growing threats from rivals in the United States and China.
The automaker has only four models, all priced toward the higher end of the market. The Cybertruck pickup is coming this year, executives said.
Tesla will also have to improve its battery technology, which Musk has called the ""fundamental limiting factor"" for the transition to sustainable energy.
In 2020, Musk unveiled a plan to develop batteries in-house, which he said would make self-driving electric cars priced at US$25,000 feasible by 2023, but Tesla has been struggling to scale up the production of the so-called 4680 batteries.
Executives on Wednesday said Tesla plans to start production of battery materials factories this year, with a lithium refinery and a cathode facility in Texas. They did not give an update on its production volume of 4680 cells."
China says ‘lab leak’ claims hurt U.S. credibility,"Other agencies within the U.S. intelligence community believe the virus emerged naturally in the world

Beijing accused Washington on Wednesday of harming its own credibility after a top U.S. intelligence official said his agency believed the pandemic ""most likely"" caused by a laboratory incident in Wuhan, China.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News on Tuesday that the Bureau has now assessed the source of COVID-19 was ""most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.""
Chinese officials have angrily denied the claim, calling it a smear campaign against Beijing.
""The United States once again stirs up the laboratory leak theory, which will not discredit China, which will further lower its own credibility,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular briefing on Wednesday.
Mr. Wray's comments come after a report earlier this week said the U.S. Department of Energy had determined that a leak from a Chinese lab was the most likely cause of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The department's findings are significant because it works with a network of national laboratories, including some that do advanced biological research.
But other agencies within the U.S. intelligence community believe the virus emerged naturally in the world.
In Tuesday's interview, Mr. Wray also accused the Chinese government of trying to stall U.S. efforts to investigate the causes of the pandemic.
""The Chinese government... has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here, the work that we're doing, the work that our U.S. government and close foreign partners are doing,"" Wray said.
""And that's unfortunate for everybody.""
At Wednesday's press briefing, Mr. Mao reiterated a longstanding and unsubstantiated Chinese claim that the virus could have escaped from the U.S. military research lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
""The U.S. should respect science and facts, cooperate with the World Health Organization as soon as possible, invite international experts to conduct traceability research in its country, and share research results with the international community,"" she said.

South Korea February factory activity shrinks for eighth month,"SEOUL : South Korea's factory activity contracted for an eighth month in February, a survey showed on Thursday, highlighting weak domestic and global economic conditions even though the downturn in output and orders eased slightly.
The S&P Global's seasonally adjusted purchasing managers' index (PMI) for South Korean manufacturers stood at 48.5 in January, unchanged from December and remaining below the 50-mark since July, 2022.
The 50-level separates expansion from contraction.
Sub-indexes showed output fell for a tenth month but at a slightly milder pace than a month before, while new orders shrank for an eighth month, with its pace also easing. New orders for exports fell for a 12th month, though the downturn eased from the previous two months.
""PMI survey data for February continued to depict subdued operating conditions in the South Korean manufacturing sector,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""On a more positive note, South Korean goods producers signalled softer albeit still sharp rises in prices midway through the first quarter.""
Soft domestic and global economic conditions and inflationary pressures, often caused by exchange rate weakness, were linked to subdued overall demand, according to the survey. Currency weakness was cited as a key driving force behind the latest drop in demand from overseas.
Reflecting weak demand, backlogs of work fell at the sharpest pace since July 2020, and stocks of finished goods jumped by the most since November 2007.
The input price inflation softened for a fourth month to the weakest level since November 2020. However, the rise in operating expenses remained sharp overall, largely pressured by a weak exchange rate and rising raw material prices.
At the same time, the rate of output price inflation also softened, with the latest increase the second-weakest in 27 months.

Dollar squeezed as inflation drives up euro,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. Dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken July 17, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo
SINGAPORE : The dollar nursed losses on Thursday as optimism about China's reopening was supported by encouraging data and underpinned Asian currencies, while sticky inflation had the euro eying its best week in a month and a half.
The dollar lost 0.9 per cent on the euro overnight, and since it moved lower despite U.S. yields rising some are speculating it might have peaked as February's rally runs out of steam.
The euro is up 1.2 per cent on the week and last bought $1.0667 with hotter-than-expected German inflation in February adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates following unexpectedly strong readings in France and Spain.
""The turn in the dollar came right on schedule as month end flows fizzled and the dominant driver of euro/dollar, rate differentials, reasserted itself,"" said Brent Donnelly, president of analytics firm Spectra Markets.
Euro zone inflation data is due later in the day.
The yen hardly budged but the dollar made broad falls on Asian currencies as it retreats from recent highs.
China's better-than-expected manufacturing activity set the yuan on its biggest one-day jump of the year so far on Wednesday, surging about 0.9 per cent.
On Thursday the yen was a tad stronger at 136.04 to the dollar in early trade while the Australian dollar held Wednesday gains made despite softer-than-expected growth data and some hints that inflation may have peaked.
""Yesterday's positive surprise in the PMIs for China in February are a positive for mining commodity prices and the currencies of countries that export them,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia's head of international economics, Joe Capurso.
""We consider the Australian dollar can increase materially in the weeks after China's Two Sessions meetings,"" he said.
""The yuan and commodity currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars can rise materially if the meeting sends a pro‑growth signal, as we expect.""
China's annual parliament meeting opens on Sunday and will implement the biggest government reshuffle in a decade, confirming President Xi Jinping's new economic team.
South Korea's won jumped more than 1 per cent on the dollar, catching up Wednesday gains after markets had been closed for a holiday. The Aussie was last at $0.6759 and the kiwi at $0.6255, while the yuan traded at 6.8731 per dollar in offshore trade. [AUD/]
Elsewhere sterling was held back by remarks from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who said ""nothing is decided"" on future rate hikes which had traders trimming back bets on higher rates. Sterling was steady at $1.2027.
Bitcoin has made little headway despite the dollar's dip and was last at $23,631. Trouble at crypto bank Silvergate has weighed on the mood and the bank's stock dropped 28 per cent on Wednesday after it warned it was delaying its annual report and evaluating its ability to operate.
Besides European inflation, euro zone employment and central bank minutes are due later in the day, as is U.S. jobless claims data.

LA County to pay US$29 million to Kobe Bryant's widow over crash photos,"NBA superstar Kobe Bryant (with wife Vanessa and daughters Gianna, L, and Natalia) was killed in a helicopter crash in January 2020. (File photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/STEPHEN DUNN)
LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles County has agreed to pay the widow of Kobe Bryant nearly US$29 million after first responders shared gruesome photos of the helicopter crash that killed the NBA superstar.
Bryant, the couple's teenage daughter Gianna, and seven others died when their chopper smashed into a hillside near Los Angeles in January 2020.
Sheriff's deputies and firefighters who rushed to the scene snapped pictures of the carnage, including the mangled remains of the Los Angeles Lakers legend and his daughter.
Bryant's widow Vanessa sued for emotional damages over the pictures, which she feared would one day surface on the internet.
Los Angeles County has now agreed to pay US$28.85 million to settle all crash-related litigation.
""Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,"" Vanessa Bryant's attorney Luis Li said in a statement.
""She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.""
Mira Hashmall, who represented Los Angeles County in the case, called the settlement ""fair and reasonable"".
""The US$28,850,000 settlement includes the verdict awarded by the federal jury in August 2022, and further resolves all outstanding issues related to pending legal claims in state court, future claims by the Bryant children, and other costs, with each party responsible for its respective attorneys' fees,"" she said Tuesday (Feb 28).
""This settlement now concludes all County-related litigation related to the tragic January 2020 helicopter crash. We hope Ms. Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss.""
The trial had heard how some of the first responders to the crash showed the photographs to members of the public including a bartender, while one sheriff's deputy texted them to a friend as the pair played the ""Call of Duty"" video game.
A tearful Vanessa Bryant told the trial she lives in fear of the pictures surfacing on the internet, and ""constantly being spread"".
""Once it's spread, you can't get it back,"" she said.
She told jurors she had bolted out of the house to find a place to cry away from her daughters when she learned of the existence of the photos.
""I broke down and cried, and I wanted to run down the block and just scream,"" she said.
""I don't want my children to ever come across them.""
Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the crash, separately settled for nearly US$20 million, US media reported.

LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles County has agreed to pay the widow of Kobe Bryant nearly US$29 million after first responders shared gruesome photos of the helicopter crash that killed the NBA superstar.
Bryant, the couple's teenage daughter Gianna, and seven others died when their chopper smashed into a hillside near Los Angeles in January 2020.
Sheriff's deputies and firefighters who rushed to the scene snapped pictures of the carnage, including the mangled remains of the Los Angeles Lakers legend and his daughter.
Bryant's widow Vanessa sued for emotional damages over the pictures, which she feared would one day surface on the internet.
Los Angeles County has now agreed to pay US$28.85 million to settle all crash-related litigation.
""Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,"" Vanessa Bryant's attorney Luis Li said in a statement.
""She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.""
Mira Hashmall, who represented Los Angeles County in the case, called the settlement ""fair and reasonable"".
""The US$28,850,000 settlement includes the verdict awarded by the federal jury in August 2022, and further resolves all outstanding issues related to pending legal claims in state court, future claims by the Bryant children, and other costs, with each party responsible for its respective attorneys' fees,"" she said Tuesday (Feb 28).
""This settlement now concludes all County-related litigation related to the tragic January 2020 helicopter crash. We hope Ms. Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss.""
The trial had heard how some of the first responders to the crash showed the photographs to members of the public including a bartender, while one sheriff's deputy texted them to a friend as the pair played the ""Call of Duty"" video game.
A tearful Vanessa Bryant told the trial she lives in fear of the pictures surfacing on the internet, and ""constantly being spread"".
""Once it's spread, you can't get it back,"" she said.
She told jurors she had bolted out of the house to find a place to cry away from her daughters when she learned of the existence of the photos.
""I broke down and cried, and I wanted to run down the block and just scream,"" she said.
""I don't want my children to ever come across them.""
Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the crash, separately settled for nearly US$20 million, US media reported.
The existence of the photographs was uncovered by the Los Angeles Times a month after the crash.
In 2007, an inquiry was launched over concerns that entertainment blogs and tabloids were offering cash to law enforcement officials for inside information on accidents and arrests.
That came after TMZ published an inside account of Mel Gibson's now-infamous anti-Semitic rant during his arrest in Malibu."
Top Al-Qaeda figure killed in Yemen air strike: sources,"Hamad bin Hamoud al-Tamimi, a top leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) died in the strike
A senior Al-Qaeda figure was killed in a suspected U.S. air strike in war-torn Yemen, security and local government sources told AFP on Wednesday.
Hamad bin Hamoud al-Tamimi, a top leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which Washington regards as among the global jihadist network's most dangerous branches, died in the strike along with a bodyguard, a security official said, requesting anonymity.
The air strike, targeting a house in the northern province of Marib that al-Tamimi had recently rented, was ""apparently American"", the official said.
A Marib government official, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the deaths.
Tamimi, a Saudi also known as Abdel Aziz al-Adnani, headed up AQAP's leadership council and acted as the militant group's ""judge"", the sources said.
The ""president of the consultative council and judge, known as Abdel Aziz al-Adnani, was killed with a Yemeni bodyguard"", the Marib official said.
AQAP, and rival militants loyal to the Islamic State group, have thrived in the chaos of Yemen's civil war, which pits the Saudi-backed government against Iran-allied Huthi rebels.
AQAP has carried out operations against both the Huthis and government forces as well as sporadic attacks abroad.
Its leaders have been targeted by a U.S. drone war for more than two decades, although the number of strikes has dropped off in recent years.
The attack comes a month after three alleged AQAP militants were killed in a suspected U.S. drone strike on a car in Marib province.
Yemen has been wracked by conflict since 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition intervened to back the government after the Huthis seized control of the capital Sanaa.

Explained | RBI’s new pilot project on coin vending machines,"How will QR-code based coin vending machines function? What has the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India said with respect to coin supply in the country?
For representative purposes only | Photo Credit: Getty Images
The story so far: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had stated during the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) address that the apex banking regulator, in collaboration with banks, would be launching a pilot project to assess the functioning of a QR-code based coin vending machine.
What is the project about?
In simple words, the vending machines would dispense coins with the requisite amount being debited from the customer’s account using United Payments Interface (UPI) instead of physical tendering of banknotes. Customers would be endowed the option of withdrawing coins in required quantities and denominations. The central idea here is to ease the accessibility to coins.
On the supply side of things, T. Rabi Shankar, Deputy Governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had stated that the situation with respect to coins was “peculiar” with the supply being “very high”. “It is taking up a lot of storage space and it is not getting properly distributed. At the same time, there is demand in pockets,” added the Deputy Governor.
The proposed mechanism for coin dispensation would be a departure from the conventional machines which relied on banknotes for facilitating coin exchanges. Further, the proposed machine would eliminate the need for physical tendering of banknotes and their authentication. It was observed that the currency being fed into the machines (for coin exchange) were often found to be fake and could not be checked right at that point of time. Thus, the mandate to eliminate the physical tendering of banknotes. The pilot is initially planned to be rolled out at 19 locations in 12 cities across the country. With particular focus on ease and accessibility, the machines are intended to be installed at public places such as railway stations, shopping mall and marketplaces.
Are coins significant in our ecosystem?
As per the latest RBI bulletin, the total value of circulation of rupee coins stood at ₹28,857 crore as of December 30 last year. The figure is an increase of 7.2% from the year-ago period. Circulation of small coins remained unchanged at ₹743 crore. For perspective, coins in India are issued in denominations of 50 paise, one rupee, two rupees, five rupees, ten rupees and twenty rupees. Coins of up to 50 paise are called ‘small coins’ while those of one rupee and above are called ‘rupee coins’.
The figures above could be compared to the volume of digital payments until December 2022 which stood at approximately ₹9,557.4 crore, as per the Digidhan Dashboard. The number is inclusive of mobile banking, internet banking, IMPS, BHIM-UPI and NEFT, among others. The reliance on UPI for dispensing coins is particularly noteworthy and it must be recalled that the payments interface for feature phones was launched in March last year. The apex regulator is also in the midst of a pilot for the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).
Is it going against the digital push?
According to Vipul Kharbanda, non-resident fellow at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) the proposal should not be viewed as a “zero-sum game of digital versus cash.” The two can easily supplement each other. “This should not be looked at from a very dogmatic point of view rather a pragmatic one. If digitalisation is not solving a particular problem at this given point of time, then it is very much within RBI’s purview to use other means available to achieve its ultimate objective that is to operate the currency system of the country,” Mr. Kharbanda argues.",2023-03-02 00:44:06.553000+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/93u8dh/article66565108.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/iStock-1353023436.jpg,the hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-rbis-new-pilot-project-on-coin-vending-machines/article66565104.ece,"Explained | RBI’s new pilot project on coin vending machinesHow will QR-code based coin vending machines function?

Dollar squeezed as inflation drives up euro,"SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Thursday as optimism about China's reopening was supported by encouraging data and underpinned Asian currencies, while sticky inflation had the euro eying its best week in a month and a half.
The dollar lost 0.9% on the euro overnight, and since it moved lower despite U.S. yields rising some are speculating it might have peaked as February's rally runs out of steam.
The euro is up 1.2% on the week and last bought $1.0667 with hotter-than-expected German inflation in February adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates following unexpectedly strong readings in France and Spain.
""The turn in the dollar came right on schedule as month end flows fizzled and the dominant driver of euro/dollar, rate differentials, reasserted itself,"" said Brent Donnelly, president of analytics firm Spectra Markets.
Euro zone inflation data is due later in the day.
The yen hardly budged but the dollar made broad falls on Asian currencies as it retreats from recent highs.
China's better-than-expected manufacturing activity set the yuan on its biggest one-day jump of the year so far on Wednesday, surging about 0.9%.
On Thursday the yen was a tad stronger at 136.04 to the dollar in early trade while the Australian dollar held Wednesday gains made despite softer-than-expected growth data and some hints that inflation may have peaked.
""Yesterday's positive surprise in the PMIs for China in February are a positive for mining commodity prices and the currencies of countries that export them,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia's head of international economics, Joe Capurso.
""We consider the Australian dollar can increase materially in the weeks after China's Two Sessions meetings,"" he said.
""The yuan and commodity currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars can rise materially if the meeting sends a pro‑growth signal, as we expect.""
China's annual parliament meeting opens on Sunday and will implement the biggest government reshuffle in a decade, confirming President Xi Jinping's new economic team.
South Korea's won jumped more than 1% on the dollar, catching up Wednesday gains after markets had been closed for a holiday. The Aussie was last at $0.6759 and the kiwi at $0.6255, while the yuan traded at 6.8731 per dollar in offshore trade.
Elsewhere sterling was held back by remarks from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who said ""nothing is decided"" on future rate hikes which had traders trimming back bets on higher rates. Sterling was steady at $1.2027.
Bitcoin has made little headway despite the dollar's dip and was last at $23,631. Trouble at crypto bank Silvergate (SI.N) has weighed on the mood and the bank's stock dropped 28% on Wednesday after it warned it was delaying its annual report and evaluating its ability to operate.
Besides European inflation, euro zone employment and central bank minutes are due later in the day, as is U.S. jobless claims data.

Analysis: Goldman Sachs faces hard sell for its consumer assets,"NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is embarking on a tough sales pitch to investors for assets in its troubled consumer business, which has dragged on earnings and may lack appeal for potential buyers.
In an unexpected move, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said on Tuesday the bank is looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for the consumer business, a signal of a possible sale.
Solomon and other executives declined to give more details about the process when they were questioned by shareholders and analysts at the company's investor day.
Goldman still holds $100 billion in deposits from its Marcus consumer banking business, $4.5 billion in personal loans, credit card partnerships with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N), and merchant lending platform GreenSky for $2.2 billion.
The deposits business under Marcus remains a core business and is not under review, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Analysts are assessing which of the remaining businesses are up for grabs, and what price they would fetch after underperforming for Goldman.
Solomon had championed Goldman's foray into consumer banking since taking the reins at the Wall Street powerhouse in 2018. The consumer operations largely failed to gain traction against well-established consumer banks and lost billions of dollars due to credit provisioning.
Observers have been critical of the bank's foray onto Main Street, which was aimed at diversifying its earnings from the more lucrative mainstays of trading and investment banking.
Goldman has not specified what options it's pursuing, but apart from outright asset sales, the bank could also recruit more investors or agree to new partnerships, a senior investment banker, who asked not to be named, said.
Those interested could be traditional banks, or Goldman could seek partnerships with certain insurance or private equity shops, the banker said.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment beyond what it told investors on Tuesday.
Goldman shares fell almost 3.8% on Tuesday after the investor gathering. Shares ended down nearly 1% on Wednesday afternoon.
""Consumer banking businesses are incredibly hard to build,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. ""The incumbent brick-and-mortar banks that everyone thought were dinosaurs actually have a unique and hard to replicate value proposition with checking accounts, cards, a branch near home and one by the office.""
Last year, Goldman folded Marcus into its newly formed asset and wealth-management unit. It also created a Platform Solutions unit to house the credit card partnerships, the GreenSky business and transaction banking.
While Platform Solutions made up only 3% of Goldman's revenue in 2022, it accounted for about 64% of the $2.72 billion the bank set aside last year for potential credit losses. The firm has also stopped personal loans under the Marcus brand and will probably wind down the $4.5 billion portfolio in the coming months, analysts said.
Greensky, a platform for home improvement loans, was acquired by Goldman in March 2022 for $2.24 billion. Spending by homeowners on refurbishing their properties boomed during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. However, the tailwinds for that market have started to abate. Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW.N) on Wednesday forecast annual sales below expectations amid a decline in the home improvement market, echoing similar commentary from peer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) last week. If Goldman sold GreenSky, it would probably get a much lower price than the $2.2 billion it paid to buy the company last year, said Ebrahim Poonawala, an analyst at Bank of America.
But taking a loss on any sale would be offset by an advantage -- removing the distraction of that business, he said. Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note that the key question about Goldman's consumer business is: ""who would be willing to buy it, and at what price?"" Analysts are also skeptical of Goldman's projection that its platforms division would break even on a pre-tax basis by 2025. JPMorgan analysts are projecting a pre-tax loss of $2.4 billion in 2023, $1.7 billion in 2024 and about $800 million in 2025. ""We still do not bake in pre-tax profitability in our model, which goes out to 2026,"" Betsy Graseck, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note.
Goldman Sachs said in an email ""we presented our path to reach pre-tax breakeven by 2025 at our Investor Day and we look forward to providing regular updates on our progress.""

"Morning Bid: For nervous markets, beware the slides of March","March 1 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.
Chinese reflation vs U.S. inflation.
That's the broad market picture painted by manufacturing PMIs for the world's two largest economies on Wednesday, as Asian stocks excluding Japan surged 2% for their best day in two months, and two of Wall Street's three main indexes slumped into the red.
How Asian markets trade on the second day of the month on Thursday may come down to which of these two forces retains the most momentum. The impact of Chinese and U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index data on Wednesday was powerful.
China's reopening from years of COVID-19 lockdown appears to be extraordinary. Manufacturing activity exploded in February, expanding at the fastest pace in more than a decade, and new export orders rose for the first time since April 2021.
On top of that, Chinese consumers are back with a bang, with some of the world's top consumer and luxury goods companies saying sales in the country are picking up again.
The U.S. manufacturing PMI report, however, prompted heavy selling across risky assets (stocks) and safe assets (bonds) alike - activity contracted for a fourth month in a row, but the prices paid index jumped much more than economists had expected.
More evidence of inflationary pressures was followed by another flurry of hawkish comments from Fed officials, sending the 10-year Treasury yield up to 4%, the two-year yield to a 16-year high near 5%, and the implied Fed terminal rate through 5.50%.
Spiraling bond yields, rates and inflation expectations aren't confined to the U.S. - euro zone PMIs also highlighted stagflationary pressures, while euro zone inflation expectations are the highest in over a decade and, in a rare occurrence, pushing above U.S. equivalents.
Can Asian markets withstand these pressures on Thursday and take their cue again from China's economic renaissance?
There are no top-tier Asian economic data releases on tap - South Korean retail sales, Australian building approvals and Japanese consumer confidence - leaving flash February euro zone inflation as perhaps the biggest market-mover of the day.
Here are three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
- South Korea retail sales (February)
- Australia building approvals (February)
- Japan consumer confidence (February)

TOKYO : Japanese companies raised spending on plant and equipment for a seventh straight quarter in the final three months of 2022, data released on Thursday showed, offering relief to policymakers counting on a private demand-led recovery from COVID.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Thursday showed Japanese firms raised capital expenditure in October-December by 7.7 per cent from the same period a year earlier.
It was the seventh straight quarter of annual gains.
The data is used to calculate revised gross domestic product (GDP) figures due on March 9. Preliminary estimates showed Japan's economy rebounded an annualised 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter.
The weaker-than-expected GDP growth was caused by a decline in capital spending, raising some doubt about whether the world's No. 3 economy can return to growth through private-sector investment and wage hikes which would in turn boost consumption.
Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted capital expenditure rose 0.5 per cent, the data showed.
The data also showed corporate recurring profits fell 2.8 per cent in the final quarter, down for the first time in eight quarters, to reach 22.3768 trillion yen.

"NBA: Grizzlies star Morant accused of punching teen, agent says incident 'self-defence'","LOS ANGELES – Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant was accused in police reports last year of punching a 17-year-old, US media reported Wednesday, his agent saying the rising National Basketball Association star acted in self-defence.
No criminal charges were filed against Morant in the incident, which took place during a pickup basketball game at Morant’s Tennessee house in July 2022.
In police records obtained by the Washington Post , the unnamed teenaged boy accused Morant of punching him “12 to 13 times” during the game.
In interviews with police the teen said that after their altercation Morant went into his house and “re-emerged with a gun visible in the waistband of his pants”.
Morant told police he “swung first” but felt he was acting in self-defence after the teenager threw a basketball that hit him in the head, later making a comment that Morant found threatening.
Morant’s agent Jim Tanner strongly denied in a statement issued Wednesday that the player had a gun.
“The July 26 incident was purely self-defence,” Tanner said in a statement that was posted on Tandem Sports and Entertainment’s Twitter feed.
“Again, this was fully investigated by law enforcement, they came to the decision not to charge Ja with any crime.
“Any of the dozens of witnesses will confirm Ja acted in self-defence and that he did not have a firearm.”
Days before that incident, the head of security at a Memphis mall told police he felt “threatened” by Morant and a group of his associates after an incident in the shopping centre’s parking lot.
Although a police report was made, no charges were filed.
TMZ reported in January that the teenager and his mother had sued Morant, and Tanner called it “disturbing that unsubstantiated rumours and gossip are being put out by people motivated to tear Ja down and tarnish his reputation for their own financial gain”.
Morant, the second overall pick in the 2019 draft and a two-time All-Star, was embroiled in controversy in early February, when the NBA investigated allegations by the Indiana Pacers that Morant’s entourage “aggressively confronted” members of their travelling party, possibly pointing a red laser at them.

Kellyanne Conway meets with prosecutors as Trump inquiry escalates,"NEW YORK – Ms Kellyanne Conway, who managed the final months of Mr Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, met with prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office on Wednesday, the latest sign that the office is ramping up its criminal investigation into the former president.
The prosecutors are scrutinising Mr Trump’s role in a hush money payment to a porn star, Ms Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with him.
The US$130,000 (S$174,000) payment was made by Mr Trump’s longtime fixer, Mr Michael Cohen, in the closing days of the 2016 campaign, and Mr Trump ultimately reimbursed him.
Mr Cohen has said that Ms Conway played a small yet notable role in the payment: she was the person Mr Cohen alerted after making the payment, he wrote in his 2020 memoir.
“I called Trump to confirm that the transaction was completed, and the documentation all in place, but he didn’t take my call – obviously a very bad sign, in hindsight,” he wrote.
Instead, he wrote, Ms Conway “called and said she’d pass along the good news”.
Ms Conway, who was seen walking into the district attorney’s office shortly before 2 pm on Wednesday, is the latest in a string of witnesses to meet with prosecutors in the last month or so.
Since district attorney Alvin Bragg impaneled a grand jury in January to hear evidence about Trump’s role in paying the hush money, at least five witnesses have testified: Mr Jeffrey McConney and Ms Deborah Tarasoff, employees of Trump’s company; Mr David Pecker and Mr Dylan Howard, two former leaders of The National Enquirer, which helped arrange the hush money deal; and Mr Keith Davidson, a former lawyer for Ms Daniels.
The decision to question those central players in the hush money saga before the grand jury suggests that Mr Bragg is nearing a decision on whether to seek an indictment of the former president.
A spokesperson for the office and a lawyer for Ms Conway declined to comment. It is unclear whether Ms Conway appeared before the grand jury or was only interviewed by prosecutors.
Still, the investigation is not complete. Mr Cohen has met with the prosecutors for several hours of questioning, though he has yet to testify in front of the grand jury.
Ms Daniels has yet to be interviewed, and Ms Conway might not be the last 2016 campaign official to face questioning.

· War to take centre stage at G20 foreign ministers' meeting
March 2 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces hung onto their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops amid signs time might be running out.
Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of its invasion a year ago on Feb. 24.
Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has nevertheless put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely.
""I would not go as far as to say the situation is critical, but it is threatening,"" Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on Ukrainian NV radio on Wednesday night.
""From my standpoint, it is not logical to defend Bakhmut at any cost,"" Rakhmanin said. ""But for the moment, Bakhmut will be defended with several aims - firstly, to inflict as many Russian losses as possible and make Russia use its ammunition and resources.""
No lines of defence should be allowed to collapse, Rakhmanin said, and ""there are two ways to approach this - an organised retreat or simple flight. And we cannot allow flight to take place under any circumstances.""
'UNDER CONTROL'
A statement on Wednesday night by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said the Russians were attempting to advance on Bakhmut ""without interruption"" and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces ""are keeping each sector of the front under control.""
Russian forces were making preparations for new attacks in central Zaporizhzhia region and on the southern front in Kherson region, the military statement said. More than 40 towns and villages were shelled, it said, including the regional centre of Kherson and other towns on the west bank of the Dnipro River, abandoned by Russian forces in November.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the latest battlefield accounts.
Thousands of civilians remain inside the ruined city of Bakhmut from a pre-war population of around 70,000.
FOREIGN MINISTERS CONFERENCE
The war took centre stage on the eve of a G20 foreign ministers' meeting in New Delhi with the EU foreign policy chief saying its success would be measured by what it could do to help end the conflict.
Ukrainians and Russians traditionally mark March 1 as the start of spring. Already, frozen ground has melted at the front, ushering in the season of sucking black mud - ""bezdorizhzhia"" in Ukrainian, ""rasputitsa"" in Russian - that has been notorious in military history for destroying attacking armies.
""Winter is over. It was a very difficult one and every Ukrainian, without exaggeration, felt the difficulties,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video message, delivered after a meeting devoted to energy issues.
""But we managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat. The threat to the energy system remains. And work goes on to ensure the energy system keeps functioning,"" Zelenskiy said.
Russia mounted regular waves of missile strikes on power stations in what Ukraine said was a calculated strategy to destroy the morale of civilians.
Ukraine and its Western allies describe Russia's war as unprovoked with the aim of crushing its European-leaning neighbour, which like Russia was part of the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union until its 1991 break-up. Russia accuses the West of provoking what it calls its ""special military operation"" to eliminate security threats, and of prolonging the conflict by backing the Kyiv government with weapons.

""But we managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat. The threat to the energy system remains. And work goes on to ensure the energy system keeps functioning,"" Zelenskiy said.
Russia mounted regular waves of missile strikes on power stations in what Ukraine said was a calculated strategy to destroy the morale of civilians.
Ukraine and its Western allies describe Russia's war as unprovoked with the aim of crushing its European-leaning neighbour, which like Russia was part of the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union until its 1991 break-up. Russia accuses the West of provoking what it calls its ""special military operation"" to eliminate security threats, and of prolonging the conflict by backing the Kyiv government with weapons.

"Silvergate slumps 28% after delaying annual report, warning about viability","March 1 (Reuters) - Silvergate Capital (SI.N) shares plummeted 28% late on Wednesday after the cryptocurrency-focused bank warned it was delaying its annual report and said it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern.
Silvergate had been trying to ease investor concerns over its future after reporting a $1 billion loss for the fourth quarter in the wake of crypto exchange FTX's bankruptcy, which shook confidence in the digital asset sector.
Federal prosecutors in Washington are probing Silvergate and its dealings with FTX and Alameda Research. In January, three U.S. senators asked Silvergate for details about its risk management practices and its dealings with FTX.
""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" Silvergate wrote in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.
Silvergate said it sold additional debt securities in January and February and that it expects further losses related to impaired securities, adding it could be ""less than well-capitalized.""
Additionally, ""the Company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements,"" according to the filing.
Silvergate said it does not expect to file its report by an extension date of March 16.
Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance had secret access to an account at Silvergate belonging to its purportedly independent U.S. partner and transferred large sums of money from the account to a trading firm managed by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Reuters reported earlier this month.

"European banks, asset managers study halving stocks settlement time","LONDON, Mar 2 (Reuters) - Banks and asset managers have set up a new task-force to study whether Europe should keep up with Wall Street by halving the time it takes to settle share trades.
The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission last month decided to cut the period for settlement or final leg of a trade, to one working day, known as T+1, from two working days, the current lag in Europe.
Halving settlement in Europe would mean banks and asset managers having to reconfigure their IT systems at a cost.
""With the U.S. having announced its intention to move to T+1 settlement by May 2024, the discussion on whether Europe should follow suit has become more pressing,"" said Adam Farkas, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).
Last September, AFME poured cold water on an idea that would require agreement between the European Union, Britain and Switzerland to avoid fragmenting share trading.
The SEC has said that T+1 would make markets more resilient to the type of volatility seen during COVID-19, and the ""meme stocks"" phenomenon on Wall Street in 2020, when social media sites fuelled heavy trading in companies like GameStop.
T+1 cuts the amount of time brokers have to tie up capital and margin to cover unsettled trades, and failure to follow suit could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to Wall Street.
The task-force will look at whether Europe should adopt T+1 -- and if so, when -- in a bid to shape regulatory thinking.
Given heavy transatlantic share trading, firms in Europe will have to make some changes to reflect the U.S. move in any case.
""An industry task force on T+1 settlement is a logical and necessary step for Europe, both in terms of managing the impacts of the U.S. move to T+1, and in considering a European timetable for a possible similar move,"" said Tanguy van de Werve, secretary general of EFAMA, the European investment funds industry body.

"China’s tech firms chase overseas AI talent to build ChatGPT rivals, amid lack of experts at home","A response in Chinese by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, is seen on its website in this illustration picture taken Feb 9, 2023. (File photo: REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration)
China's tech firms are scrambling to woo Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) experts from abroad – especially those at OpenAI, the US start-up behind ChatGPT – to help create their own chatbots, according to industry insiders and recruitment agencies.
ChatGPT, which is capable of generating human-like responses to complex questions, has taken the world by storm since its launch in late November, spurring an arms race among global technology giants rushing to introduce their own versions.
With the supply of AI scientists falling short of rising demand in China, however, the frenzy around AI chatbots has exacerbated a talent gap in the country, recruiters said.
Both top and second-tier players in China’s technology industry are looking to hire AI experts with Chinese backgrounds from overseas, to integrate technologies similar to ChatGPT into their product offerings, with members from the original OpenAI team that launched the chatbot being the most sought-after, according to Liang Hongjing, partner at Shenzhen-based headhunting agency CGL Consulting.
“I’ve helped local research facilities and top internet firms recruit the research heads and chief scientists … Now I’m looking to (help Chinese tech firms) recruit those with experience in large language models,” Liang said, adding that his clients want to hire from abroad because it is difficult to find experts in the field on the mainland.
“Large language models are not a new concept in China, but there are just too few companies that have worked in that path,” Liang said.
The supply of AI talent in China has fluctuated in the past few years, according to Liu Jingfeng, a senior researcher at Beijing-based technology think tank Jazzyear.
In 2017, AI firms in China – including the four “AI dragons” of CloudWalk Technology, Yitu Technology, SenseTime and Megvii – drove a hiring boom, riding on enthusiasm surrounding the use of computer vision technology in industrial scenarios.
As the fervour around computer vision cooled, however, the AI sector saw a plunge in talent, as many workers left amid declining salaries, Liu said. But the sudden popularity of ChatGPT has reignited investment interest in the field.
Still, it could be a tall order for Chinese companies and recruitment agencies to poach Chinese experts who have already left home, according to CGL’s Liang.
“Returning to China will be a high-cost move for these people, who will have to leave their tenure, cars, houses, and even families behind,” he said, even though companies are willing to offer salary packages of between tens of thousands to several million yuan to attract the right talent.
Despite the drawbacks, some Chinese researchers who have been working in Western countries may find the lack of a glass ceiling at home a major appeal, according to Liang.
The amount of opportunities still available in China’s internet sector may also be a big draw, he added.
“The Chinese internet market, regardless of its issues, is still very fascinating,” Liang said. “The speed at which China’s tech sector and the economy have grown in the past decade has produced way more surprises than what the overseas market could have offered.”

Tennis: Djokovic eyes elusive gold at Paris Olympics,"DUBAI – Novak Djokovic is hoping the Paris 2024 Games will be his most successful Olympics to date, as he continues to chase the gold medal that has so far eluded him.
After notching an impressive straight-sets victory over Dutch world No. 39 Tallon Griekspoor on Wednesday to reach his 13th Dubai Tennis Championship quarter-final in as many appearances, Djokovic spoke about his ambitions for the Olympic Games next year.
“I hope that I’ll be able to play healthy for next year’s Paris Olympics,” said Djokovic, whose best showing at the Games so far came in 2008 when he won bronze in singles.
“It’s going to be played on clay at Roland Garros, I’m familiar with those grounds, so I hope that the best Olympic result for me will come there.”
Two of Djokovic’s 22 Grand Slam titles have come at Roland Garros, in 2016 and 2021.
With a far more straightforward display compared to his opening round in Dubai, Djokovic extended his undefeated run this season to 14-0 – and his overall winning streak to 19 matches – with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Griekspoor, who is one of the most improved players on tour these past two months.
It was a clean performance from Djokovic, who dropped just two points behind his first serve and fired 29 winners against a mere six unforced errors.
“It’s been a great evening for me tonight. Yesterday I really had to work hard to get a win,” said five-time Dubai champion Djokovic, who squeezed past world No. 130 Tomas Machac with a third-set tiebreak victory in the first round.
“Tonight I think right from the blocks, from the beginning I was sharp.”
Djokovic broke at the start of the match before play was interrupted due to light rain. The brief delay did nothing to disrupt the top seed’s rhythm though, as he comfortably scooped the opening set in 34 minutes.
The 35-year-old leapt to a 3-0 lead in the second set but had to battle through a marathon 16-minute game to make it 4-0.

Tesla touts plans to halve vehicle production costs,"SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla will cut vehicle assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors on Wednesday, outlining design and factory efficiency gains as fans waited for chief executive Elon Musk to unveil a new model.
In the first two hours of the presentation, Tesla executives led by Mr Musk discussed everything from a white-paper plan for the globe to embrace sustainable energy to the company’s innovation in managing its operations from manufacturing to service.
Mr Musk had been expected to lay out a plan to make a small, affordable electric vehicle (EV) that would broaden his brand’s appeal and fend off competition, and he presented a slide showing two disguised future models.
But by late in the presentation executives had not detailed new vehicle plans or financial targets, and Tesla shares were down about 3 per cent in after-hours trading.
The presentation featured an array of engineers, a nod to Tesla’s attempt to show the depth of its executive bench beyond Musk. Late in the presentation, Tom Zhu, the new global production chief, took the stage and said Tesla’s global capacity was 2 million vehicles a year.
Capturing the mass market is critical to Tesla’s goal of increasing deliveries 15-fold - to 20 million vehicles - by 2030.
Tesla already has a significant lead over its rivals in manufacturing EVs at a profit. Chief engineer Lars Moravy said the company expects to build its next-generation vehicles for half the cost of the current Model 3 or Model Y.
Mr Moravy described a production process for future EVs he called an “unboxed” model that would deliver lower costs by snapping together sub-assemblies and reducing complexity and time in assembly.
Tesla executive Peter Bannon gave an example of how the company uses data to cut costs. Customer data showed Tesla owners did not use the sun roof, he said, “so we removed it.”
High-profile Tesla investor Ross Gerber tweeted that the presentation amounted to a “Huge tease” on the next-generation vehicle. “It’s coming. They laid it all out. 50 per cent less cost to build. Would get you a US$25-US$30k EV!”
Mr Musk showed a chart of Tesla’s projection of the future electric fleet. The slide depicted the EV maker’s existing models, including the Semi truck, as part of a market projected at 440 million vehicles. It showed the Cybertruck and a shrouded future model as part of a 300 million-vehicle market. An additional, smaller shrouded model was shown as part of the largest market in its projection: 700 million vehicles.
Tesla also is opening up its charging stations to other brands of electric vehicles, with the first 10 US Supercharger sites opening to non-Teslas on Tuesday. Executives said the company also was focused on developing charging infrastructure in commercial parking, beyond the Supercharger network.
Tesla also will have to improve its battery technology, which Mr Musk has called the “fundamental limiting factor” for the transition to sustainable energy, making it a potential topic for Wednesday’s address.",2023-03-02 00:22:46.232000+00:00,https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2023/03/02/2023-03-01T212921Z1369862111RC28LZ9AF8Z3RTRMADP3TESLA-CRASH_0.JPG?VersionId=gBlW0k_oBGyqGx0s_tw0LFBRyG1lAEeP,Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/tesla-touts-plans-to-halve-vehicle-production-costs,"Tesla touts plans to halve vehicle production costsSAN FRANCISCO - Tesla will cut vehicle assembly costs by half in future generations of cars, engineers told investors on Wednesday, outlining design and factory efficiency gains as fans waited for chief executive Elon Musk to unveil a new model.

An additional, smaller shrouded model was shown as part of the largest market in its projection: 700 million vehicles.
Tesla also is opening up its charging stations to other brands of electric vehicles, with the first 10 US Supercharger sites opening to non-Teslas on Tuesday. Executives said the company also was focused on developing charging infrastructure in commercial parking, beyond the Supercharger network.
Tesla also will have to improve its battery technology, which Mr Musk has called the “fundamental limiting factor” for the transition to sustainable energy, making it a potential topic for Wednesday’s address."
"South Korea promises all out efforts to boost exports, attract tourists","SEOUL - South Korea’s government on Thursday promised to make efforts to boost exports and attract tourists as the statistics agency released a mixed set of data for January that showed gloomy prospects for the economy.
Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho said at a meeting of officials the likelihood of a quick export recovery were limited, but that government ministries would do their best to achieve a goal of averting a decline in exports.
He also said the government would make efforts to attract more foreign tourists, whose arrivals so far this year he said have recovered to some 40 per cent of the levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020.
The comments came as Statistics Korea data showed Asia’s fourth-largest economy could be headed for a recession, with the cyclically adjusted coincident index falling in January for a fourth consecutive month.
Industrial output rose on the month but plunged on the year, while retail sales decreased for a third consecutive month, the data showed.
The trade-reliant economy contracted by an estimated 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the previous quarter as exports collapsed.

"BJP giving ‘One District One Product’, Opposition gave ‘One District One Mafia’, says CM Yogi","When the Opposition has no relevant argument, they come up with the caste angle to divert the attention of society, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister alleges

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday reacted strongly to Opposition allegations, and claimed that while the Samajwadi Party (SP) gave ‘One District One Mafia’ to the State, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is making efforts for ‘One District One Product’, giving new life to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
“One District One Product has given a new life to MSMEs. The State become the hub of exports. We are providing more than double the employment as compared to 2016-17. In the financial year 2021-22, the total exports from U.P. is valued at ₹1,56,000 crore. Before 2017, every district of Uttar Pradesh had a mafia. Everyone was aware of it. Organised mining mafias, forest mafias and criminal gangs were common. The SP promoted ‘One District One Mafia’ while we promote ‘One District One Product’,” the CM said.
Mr. Adityanath was responding to Leader of the Opposition Akhilesh Yadav’s allegations in which he mocked the State government’s efforts regarding economic development and an ambitious target of a $1 trillion economy.
“The proposals worth ₹34.09 lakh crore are a validation of the people’s trust in the Uttar Pradesh government and its credibility. Why didn’t this come before 2017?” he asked.
The CM argued that the U.P. government accepts the challenges it faces and tries to overcome them. “What type of government there should be? One which runs away or accepts them as a challenge and works on a policy of zero tolerance towards corruption and crime. Our government accepted every challenge in the last six years with full commitment,” said Mr. Adityanath, while thanking all the 134 members who participated in the discussion on Budget 2023-24 in the State Assembly.
Speaking on the issue of the much-discussed ‘Caste Census’, Mr. Adityanath said vaccines, tests and rations during the pandemic were not given based on caste and alleged when the Opposition has no relevant argument, they come up with the caste angle to divert the attention of the society.
“The previous government in 2016-17 discontinued scholarships of 21,21,629 students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Our government gave those pending scholarships to them. When the Opposition has no relevant argument, they come up with the caste angle to divert the attention of society.

Shock as fake man found at police sub-inspector training in Gujarat,"Mayur Tadavi never appeared in any written or physical exam and yet he managed to join the training for the newly recruited sub-inspectors and even received one month’s salary
The Gujarat police were shocked on Tuesday when one Mayur Tadavi was found taking training along with 1,381 other candidates who had passed two-level exams to be selected as sub-inspectors.
Mr. Tadavi never appeared in any written or physical exam and yet he managed to join the training for the newly recruited sub-inspectors and even received one month’s salary.
On Tuesday, the police told the media that one person was found illegally training and a probe has been launched to find how he managed to get a fake letter and other documents and joined the training for the new batch.
In 2022, about 1,382 candidates were recruited through the examination by the Police Recruitment Board chaired by Director General of Police Vikas Sahay, and four other board members.
AAP’s charge
The police were prompted to launch a probe after whistle-blower and AAP leader Yuvrajsinh Jadeja, in a press conference, said one candidate who was now under training in the Karai police training centre in Gandhinagar had not appeared in any exam and whose name was not there in the form, physical test results or final results.
“His name was not even mentioned in the allotment letter procured from Vadodara as he was from Vadodara. However, he is under PSI training and has even received a salary for a month,” Mr. Jadeja told the media, alleging corruption in the recruitment exam.
“I believe at least 10 such persons have been admitted to the police force in such a manner through corruption so cross-verification of all the 1,382 candidates selected in this exam must be done,” Mr. Jadeja said on Monday.
On Tuesday, the police found Mr. Tadavi getting the training with others in the State’s main police training centre.
“It is shocking that it has happened. There are multiple checks and levels and yet a person who never appeared in the exam could manage to enter the system completely illegally,” a State government official said.
Suspended from House
Meanwhile, 19 legislators of the Congress and the AAP were on Wednesday suspended from the Assembly after they protested in the House demanding an immediate discussion on Mr. Tadavi illegally training at a police academy in Karai, Gandhinagar.
After the Question Hour, the opposition members said the issue of a fake sub-inspector training at the Gujarat Police Academy in Karai must be discussed under Rule 116 of and asked if it could be taken up immediately.
The rule mandates discussion of any urgent issue of public interest when the session is under way.
“First the recruitment exam papers got leaked and one Mayur Tadavi, who did not take any exam and yet has been found illegally training at a police academy,” Congress CLP leader Amit Chavda said.
He and other members of the Congress and the AAP demanded that the Chief Minister or the Home Minister reassure the people that there is no corruption in the recruitment exams.
Harsh Sanghvi, Junior Home Minister, told the House that the police had launched a “secret inquiry” after Mr. Tadavi was found at the training academy.

US arrests man with explosive device in luggage at Pennsylvania airport,"WASHINGTON - A man was arrested and charged with attempting to place an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft after his bag triggered an alarm at Lehigh Valley International Airport in Pennsylvania, said US authorities on Wednesday.
The FBI said that Mark Muffley, 40, from Lansford, Pennsylvania, checked a suitcase on Monday for a flight that was heading to Sanford, Florida.
The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said one of its official located a suspicious item inside the suitcase that appeared to be a live explosive device.
“FBI and local law enforcement bomb technicians determined that the item was indeed a live explosive device,” a TSA spokesperson said.
The bag triggered an alarm and officials found what they described as a “circular compound” hidden in the lining of the baggage, with two fuses and powder concealed in wax paper and plastic wrap, the FBI said in its formal complaint.
The “powder is suspected to be a mixture of flash powder and the dark granulars that are used in commercial grade fireworks,” the complaint added.
“The black powder and flash powder are susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and posed a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.”
After the alarm went off, authorities paged Muffley to report to security at the airport.
Minutes later, Muffley was seen leaving the airport, the FBI added. Later that evening, he was arrested at his home.
Further details on the incident, including Muffley’s alleged intent, were not immediately known. Reuters could not immediately contact Muffley or a representative.
ABC News reported Muffley was due in court on Thursday.
The airport said it had closed a part of its main terminal briefly on Monday while authorities probed the suspicious package.

Ukraine military may pull out troops from Bakhmut,"A medic gives first aid to a wounded Ukrainian soldier near Bakhmut, the site of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops, Donetsk region, Ukraine on February 27, 2023. | Photo Credit: AP
The Ukrainian military might decide to pull troops back from the key stronghold of Bakhmut, an adviser to Ukraine's president said Wednesday as Russia pursued a bloody, months-long offensive to capture the city.
“Our military is obviously going to weigh all of the options. So far, they’ve held the city, but if need be, they will strategically pull back,"" Alexander Rodnyansky, an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told CNN. “We’re not going to sacrifice all of our people just for nothing.”
The battle for Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as defenders hold out against relentless shelling and Russian troops suffer heavy casualties in the campaign to take the city.
Mr. Rodnyansky noted that Russia was using the best troops of the Wagner Group to try to encircle the city. The private military company known for brutal tactics is led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rogue millionaire with longtime links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Mr. Prigozhin said on Wednesday that he so far had seen no signs of a Ukrainian withdrawal from the city. He maintained that Kyiv has in fact been reinforcing its positions there.
“The Ukrainian Army is deploying additional troops and is doing what it can to retain control of the city,” Mr. Prigozhin said. “Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are offering fierce resistance, and the fighting is getting increasingly bloody by day.”
Recent drone footage shows the scale of devastation in the city, while Mr. Zelensky has described it as “destroyed.”
Since invading Ukraine a year ago, Russia has bombarded various cities and towns that it wanted to occupy. It also targeted Ukraine's power supply with missile strikes ahead of winter in an apparent attempt to weaken local morale.
While Western analysts have warned that warmer weather might give Moscow an opportunity to launch a renewed offensive, Ukrainian officials nonetheless celebrated Wednesday what is regarded nationally as the first day of spring.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba announced that his country had survived Putin’s “winter terror.”
“We survived the most difficult winter in our history,” Mr. Kuleba wrote on Facebook.
The war could become a protracted conflict, analysts say, and Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Kariņs said that would demand a response from Kyiv’s Western allies.
“This is potentially for many years to come where we will have to readapt our militaries, our military industry, to be able to step up to a much, much bigger challenge,” Mr. Karins said after talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
Meanwhile, one of Mr. Zelensky's top advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied on Wednesday that Ukraine had used drones to attack Russian territory following Russian official statements that Ukraine had targeted infrastructure deep inside Russia.
“Ukraine does not strike on the territory of the Russian Federation. Ukraine is waging a defensive war with the aim of de-occupying all its territories,"" Mr. Podolyak wrote on Twitter, suggesting the targeting of Russian infrastructure was the result of “internal attacks.”
Ukraine’s western allies have discouraged Ukraine from attacking targets in Russia proper to avoid escalation of the conflict, and Mr. Podolyak’s statement could reflect an attempt by Kyiv to maintain a degree of deniability in view of those Western concerns.
In the past, Ukrainian officials have stopped short of claiming responsibility for attacks in Russia, but also insisted that Ukraine has the right to strike any target on Russian territory in response to its aggression.
Asked about Mr. Podolyak’s denial, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “We don’t believe it.”
Pictures of a drone that fell near the village of Gubastovo, less than 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Moscow, showed it was a small Ukrainian-made model with a reported range of up to 800 kilometres (nearly 500 miles), but no capacity to carry a large load of explosives.
Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday it prevented a massive drone attack on Crimea. According to Russian state media, six drones were shot down by air defence forces, while four more were disabled by electronic warfare systems.
In Ukraine, at least nine civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded across the country on Tuesday, the Ukrainian President’s office reported on Wednesday morning.
Three people, including a one-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern Kherson province on Wednesday, regional officials reported.
Fierce fighting also continued in Donetsk province, with Bakhmut, the cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar, and 17 towns and villages, coming under intense Russian shelling.",2023-03-02 00:13:03.045000+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/l6doje/article66569420.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/APTOPIX_Russia_Ukraine_War_17808.jpg,the hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukraine-military-may-pull-out-troops-from-bakhmut/article66569342.ece,"Ukraine military may pull out troops from BakhmutA medic gives first aid to a wounded Ukrainian soldier near Bakhmut, the site of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops, Donetsk region, Ukraine on February 27, 2023. | Photo Credit: AP

“The Ukrainian Army is deploying additional troops and is doing what it can to retain control of the city,” Mr. Prigozhin said. “Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are offering fierce resistance, and the fighting is getting increasingly bloody by day.”
Recent drone footage shows the scale of devastation in the city, while Mr. Zelensky has described it as “destroyed.”
Since invading Ukraine a year ago, Russia has bombarded various cities and towns that it wanted to occupy. It also targeted Ukraine's power supply with missile strikes ahead of winter in an apparent attempt to weaken local morale.
While Western analysts have warned that warmer weather might give Moscow an opportunity to launch a renewed offensive, Ukrainian officials nonetheless celebrated Wednesday what is regarded nationally as the first day of spring.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba announced that his country had survived Putin’s “winter terror.”
“We survived the most difficult winter in our history,” Mr. Kuleba wrote on Facebook.
The war could become a protracted conflict, analysts say, and Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Kariņs said that would demand a response from Kyiv’s Western allies.
“This is potentially for many years to come where we will have to readapt our militaries, our military industry, to be able to step up to a much, much bigger challenge,” Mr. Karins said after talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
Meanwhile, one of Mr. Zelensky's top advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied on Wednesday that Ukraine had used drones to attack Russian territory following Russian official statements that Ukraine had targeted infrastructure deep inside Russia.
“Ukraine does not strike on the territory of the Russian Federation. Ukraine is waging a defensive war with the aim of de-occupying all its territories,"" Mr. Podolyak wrote on Twitter, suggesting the targeting of Russian infrastructure was the result of “internal attacks.”
Ukraine’s western allies have discouraged Ukraine from attacking targets in Russia proper to avoid escalation of the conflict, and Mr. Podolyak’s statement could reflect an attempt by Kyiv to maintain a degree of deniability in view of those Western concerns.
In the past, Ukrainian officials have stopped short of claiming responsibility for attacks in Russia, but also insisted that Ukraine has the right to strike any target on Russian territory in response to its aggression.
Asked about Mr. Podolyak’s denial, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “We don’t believe it.”
Pictures of a drone that fell near the village of Gubastovo, less than 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Moscow, showed it was a small Ukrainian-made model with a reported range of up to 800 kilometres (nearly 500 miles), but no capacity to carry a large load of explosives.
Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday it prevented a massive drone attack on Crimea. According to Russian state media, six drones were shot down by air defence forces, while four more were disabled by electronic warfare systems.
In Ukraine, at least nine civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded across the country on Tuesday, the Ukrainian President’s office reported on Wednesday morning.
Three people, including a one-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian shelling of Ukraine’s southern Kherson province on Wednesday, regional officials reported.
Fierce fighting also continued in Donetsk province, with Bakhmut, the cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar, and 17 towns and villages, coming under intense Russian shelling."
House of Atique Ahmed’s close aide bulldozed in Prayagraj,"Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel stand guard as a bulldozer demolishes the house of Khalid Zafar, the accused and close aide of gangster Atique Ahmed, in Prayagraj on Wednesday. | Photo Credit: ANI
The Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) on Wednesday demolished the house of an aide of criminal-turned-politician Atique Ahmed, located in Chakia, under the Kareli police station of Prayagraj for being illegally constructed. The house belonging to Khalid Zafar, a close associate of the former MP, was under the radar of authorities for sometime and notice was issued in the past for being illegally constructed. It is estimated that cost of the house was roughly ₹2 crore.
Speaking with local media persons, PDA Secretary Ajit Singh said “the house belonging to Zafar has been bulldozed and some firearms were recovered which have been handed over to the police. The construction was carried out without prior approval of the authority and in the past also notice was issued.”

The action comes two days after the Uttar Pradesh police and the Special Operations Group of the State police shot dead Arbaaz, an accused in the murder of Umesh Pal, a prime witness in the sensational 2005 murder case of Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Raju Pal. Umesh Pal was shot dead outside his house last week; the video of the tragic incident went viral on social media, leading to uproar over the law and order situation in the State. In the murder case, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against Atique Ahmed, his wife Shaista Parveen, two sons and dozens of others.

Analysis | Why the Karnataka Assembly polls are crucial for BJP’s fate in Telangana,"File picture of BJP Telangana president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Union Minister for Tourism and Culture G. Kishan Reddy and BJP National President J.P. Nadda in Karimnagar. The support for the party has been growing in the State in recent times | Photo Credit: Nagara Gopal
In a year with nine Assembly elections, the Karnataka polls in April-May stand alone as the State goes to polls without being bunched with others. But for the BJP, this time around, the party’s fate in Karnataka is inextricably linked with that of Telangana.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won four seats in Telangana, marking it out as a potential State where the party can expand. The BJP’s efforts in the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls, in fighting Assembly bypolls in Huzurabad, Munugode and Dubbaka and in the yatras and corner public meetings point to that direction.
At a meeting of the national and Telangana BJP leadership in Delhi, however, some concerns were raised that there were blank spots with regard to grassroot organisational level coverage in several districts of the State, and that leaders from other parties (Congress and the Bharata Rashtra Samithi) that had been scheduled fell through. It was seen that there was no representation from many of the 119 Assembly seats in the State in the party organisation.
The inability to recruit talent, to bridge deficits in leadership was raised during the meeting. It is this inability that has the most direct connection with the BJP’s prospects in Karnataka.
According to a senior office bearer of the BJP in New Delhi involved in party affairs in Telangana, the results in Karnataka Assembly polls will have a direct effect on Telangana.
“In Karnataka, the only southern State the BJP has won, the party is facing a challenging situation. Leaders from other parties desirous of joining the BJP are watching the events closely. If the BJP loses Karnataka where the Congress is fighting hard, then it will have a morale boosting effect on the Congress, and the currently loose hold that the Congress has on leaders will strengthen, making it difficult for the BJP to convince anyone to join. A victory in Karnataka will have an opposite effect,” said the source.
“It’s a question of momentum, and a loss in Karnataka may lead to a flagging of momentum for the Telangana BJP,” added the source.
The BJP has, in recent times, been able to combine identity politics with that of welfare programmes of the Modi government with labaarthis (beneficiaries) being a strong pillar of support. In Telangana, the labarthi plank has weakened as the BRS government in the State has its own constituency of labarthis through its various schemes.
“Therefore, the narrative here has to be on governance issues, corruption and getting a good combination of community leaders to support you. The Congress has a legacy vote even if the party is in the doldrums at the moment, the BJP as a latecomer has challenges,” said the source.
The meeting between the national leadership of the BJP and Telangana leaders in Delhi on Tuesday, and the announcement of a micro-level campaign of public meetings and outreach, was also combined with some frank talk on the need for the party to attract talent. The differences between old and newly inducted leaders of the party were also sought to be smoothened over.

British air force chief calls it 'unacceptable' for China to recruit Western military pilots,"Residents walk by a large screen showing the Chinese People's Liberation Army Airforce outside a mall in Beijing, on Jan 9, 2023. (Photo: AP/Andy Wong)
SYDNEY: Britain's air force chief says it was ""unacceptable"" its former pilots were being recruited to train Chinese military, and intelligence agencies in Australia and Britain had shared information to warn pilots against working for Beijing.
In October Britain said it would change the law to make it an offence for a former military pilot to continue training a foreign military after being warned by British intelligence agencies to stop.
The Royal Air Force's Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston told the ABC in an interview at the Avalon Air Show in Australia the warnings were about China.
""We made the decision to go public on this in a very loud, clear way, that it's unacceptable and it's something that we were prepared to call China out publicly,"" he said.
Australia said it will also tighten the law to stop the practice. Australia's spy chief last week hit out in his annual security threat assessment at former military pilots who turn to working for authoritarian regimes, describing them as ""lackeys, more 'top tools' than 'top guns'"".

California officially ends COVID-19 state of emergency,"LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The COVID-19 emergency state in California, the most populous state of the United States, officially ended on Tuesday, nearly three years after Governor Gavin Newsom issued the country's first statewide stay-at-home order.
Newsom issued a proclamation on Tuesday terminating California's COVID-19 state of emergency. Since March 2020, the statewide emergency declaration has given Newsom the power to suspend or change laws in California to fight the spread of COVID-19.
Previously, the state government has lifted most of its COVID-19 restrictions, including mask mandates, restaurant dining capacity and vaccination proof for indoor sites.
California's COVID-19 death rate was among the lowest in the nation, according to data released by Newsom's office.
The state has administered more than 88 million COVID-19 vaccines, with nearly 73 percent of California's population being vaccinated, data showed.
""People who lost their life to COVID, people who lost neighbors and loved ones, we lament and are still saddened by that,"" said California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly. ""But to get to this point where we feel prepared to lift the state of emergency to move forward, that's a big deal for Californians across the state.""
At this point in the pandemic, most people have some sort of immunity to COVID-19 from vaccination or infection, or both, said Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of California, Davis.
""The risk of severe disease is less at this point, but it's not zero,"" Blumberg said.
COVID-19 is becoming more like influenza, he added. ""Most people who are not at high risk will be inconvenienced if infected, but the risk of hospitalization or death is low.""
The pandemic strained California's health care system, which has yet to fully recover, according to Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association.
Coyle said hospitals remain overwhelmed, not from COVID patients, but from an influx of people returning to the health care system after staying away during the pandemic.
A majority of California's hospitals are losing money, prompting fears some could close, just as a community hospital in the state's Central Valley did in December, she said.
""While the state's COVID public health emergency is formally concluding, the health care system emergency remains,"" she said.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Beijing on Wednesday.
Xi said in Samarkand in September last year, he and Lukashenko jointly announced upgrading bilateral relations to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership, injecting strong impetus into bilateral cooperation in various fields.
For China, this year marks the beginning of the full implementation of the guiding principles laid down at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). China's high-quality development and modernization process will bring new opportunities to other countries including Belarus, Xi said.
Hailing the unbreakable China-Belarus friendship, Xi stressed that the two sides should further enhance political mutual trust and remain each other's good friends and partners.
He said China highly appreciates Belarus's firm support for China's justified position on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and on human rights.
The two sides should firmly support each other's choice of development path, support each other in safeguarding respective core interests, oppose external interference in internal affairs, and protect their sovereignty and political security, Xi said.
The two presidents agreed to expand economic and trade cooperation, do a good job in building the China-Belarus Industrial Park, and focus on the joint building of the Belt and Road to advance cooperation in connectivity projects such as the China-Europe Railway Express service.
They pledged to jointly implement the China-proposed Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.
""Faced with the unstable and uncertain international situation, China is ready to work with Belarus to promote the sound and stable development of bilateral relations at a high level,"" Xi told Lukashenko.
China is ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Belarus at multilateral fora, including the United Nations, to jointly address global challenges and build a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said.
Lukashenko said that China is a mainstay in safeguarding world peace. Belarus is willing to strengthen coordination with China on major international and regional issues and jointly commit to safeguarding international and regional security and stability, he said.
Congratulating China on the success of the 20th CPC National Congress, Lukashenko said President Xi is a beloved leader for the Chinese people and enjoys great prestige in the world, adding that he is convinced that China will continue to make new brilliant achievements under his strong leadership.
Lukashenko offered his wishes for complete success in the upcoming annual sessions of China's national legislature and top political advisory body, saying he believed they will have an important impact on the future of China and the world.
The two heads of state also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and other issues. Xi pointed out that China's stance on the Ukraine crisis has been consistent and clear, and China has already released a paper stating its position on the political settlement of the crisis.
""China's position boils down to supporting talks for peace,"" Xi stressed, calling for adherence to the direction of political settlement, abandoning the Cold War mentality, respecting legitimate security concerns, and helping forge a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
Instead of politicizing the world economy or using it as a tool, relevant countries should do things that are conducive to a ceasefire and the peaceful settlement of the crisis, Xi said.
Lukashenko said the Belarusian side fully agrees with and supports China's position and proposals on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, which is of great significance in finding a resolution.
The two heads of state signed a joint declaration on furthering the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era and witnessed the signing of cooperation documents on economy and trade, industry, agriculture, customs, science and technology, health, tourism, sports and sub-national levels.
Prior to the talks, Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Lukashenko in the Northern Hall of the Great Hall of the People. After the talks, Xi hosted a welcoming banquet for the Belarusian leader. ■

For China, this year marks the beginning of the full implementation of the guiding principles laid down at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). China's high-quality development and modernization process will bring new opportunities to other countries including Belarus, Xi said.
Hailing the unbreakable China-Belarus friendship, Xi stressed that the two sides should further enhance political mutual trust and remain each other's good friends and partners.
He said China highly appreciates Belarus's firm support for China's justified position on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and on human rights.
The two sides should firmly support each other's choice of development path, support each other in safeguarding respective core interests, oppose external interference in internal affairs, and protect their sovereignty and political security, Xi said.
The two presidents agreed to expand economic and trade cooperation, do a good job in building the China-Belarus Industrial Park, and focus on the joint building of the Belt and Road to advance cooperation in connectivity projects such as the China-Europe Railway Express service.
They pledged to jointly implement the China-proposed Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.
""Faced with the unstable and uncertain international situation, China is ready to work with Belarus to promote the sound and stable development of bilateral relations at a high level,"" Xi told Lukashenko.
China is ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Belarus at multilateral fora, including the United Nations, to jointly address global challenges and build a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said.
Lukashenko said that China is a mainstay in safeguarding world peace. Belarus is willing to strengthen coordination with China on major international and regional issues and jointly commit to safeguarding international and regional security and stability, he said.
Congratulating China on the success of the 20th CPC National Congress, Lukashenko said President Xi is a beloved leader for the Chinese people and enjoys great prestige in the world, adding that he is convinced that China will continue to make new brilliant achievements under his strong leadership.
Lukashenko offered his wishes for complete success in the upcoming annual sessions of China's national legislature and top political advisory body, saying he believed they will have an important impact on the future of China and the world.
The two heads of state also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and other issues. Xi pointed out that China's stance on the Ukraine crisis has been consistent and clear, and China has already released a paper stating its position on the political settlement of the crisis.
""China's position boils down to supporting talks for peace,"" Xi stressed, calling for adherence to the direction of political settlement, abandoning the Cold War mentality, respecting legitimate security concerns, and helping forge a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
Instead of politicizing the world economy or using it as a tool, relevant countries should do things that are conducive to a ceasefire and the peaceful settlement of the crisis, Xi said.
Lukashenko said the Belarusian side fully agrees with and supports China's position and proposals on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, which is of great significance in finding a resolution.
The two heads of state signed a joint declaration on furthering the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era and witnessed the signing of cooperation documents on economy and trade, industry, agriculture, customs, science and technology, health, tourism, sports and sub-national levels.
Prior to the talks, Xi held a welcoming ceremony for Lukashenko in the Northern Hall of the Great Hall of the People. After the talks, Xi hosted a welcoming banquet for the Belarusian leader. ■
